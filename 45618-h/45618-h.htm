<p class="chaptitle">THE GREAT HOLD-UP.</p>


<p>Toot!</p>

<p>"What's the mischief?" cried the fireman.</p>

<p>He sprung to his box and looked ahead,
and in the center of the track, where the
train was rounding a point of rocks, saw a
red flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>"That fool of a section boss has got
another rail up, on our time, I suppose,
as he did once before," growled the engineer,
having shut off steam and applied
the air brakes.</p>

<p>Toot!</p>

<p>Another short, sharp blast of the
whistle, and the engineer reversed his
engine, while the fireman leaped down
and prepared to jump.</p>

<p>Both had beheld something well calculated
to chill their blood, the moment
the engine had rounded the bend far
enough to give them a view of the
straight stretch ahead!</p>

<p>About half way down to a point where
the track again curved, a number of
boulders had been placed between the
rails, and on both sides of the track stood
masked men with rifles in their hands.
That they meant business was not to be
questioned.</p>

<p>"Held up, by thunder!"</p>

<p>Such was the exclamation uttered by
the engineer, as he reached for the
whistle and sounded the second alarm,
and, having reversed, as mentioned, he,
too, prepared to jump.</p>

<p>But that was not necessary. As if the
train robbers had calculated to the foot
the distance from the curve at which to
place the obstruction, they saw the train
slow up, under the force of the powerful
brakes, and when the engine stopped
the nose of the pilot was but a score of
inches from the boulders.</p>

<p>"Hands up, or take lead straight!"</p>

<p>So cried the leader, and a man on each
side of the engine covered the engineer
and fireman.</p>

<p>Needless to say, they promptly obeyed
the order. At the same moment other
members of the band made a dash for
the express-car, which was next to the
engine.</p>

<p>Still others had sprung up alongside
the track the moment the train came to
a standstill, and boarded the cars to take
care of the passengers while the leader
and those with him made their raid upon
the car which contained the treasure
they were after.</p>

<p>But, were they after any special treasure,
or was it only a coincidence that
they had chosen that particular train for
their prey?</p>

<p>It looked the former.</p>

<p>"Looks like we're in for it," observed
the fireman, as he held his hands on
high.</p>

<p>"That's what it does," agreed the engineer,
in easy manner of speech, taking
care to keep his hands well up. "There
is no use kicking when they have got
us lined with Winchesters."</p>

<p>"That's hoss sense," averred one of
the raiders, who stood guard over them.
"You fellers keep yer hands straight up,
and you won't come to no harm. We
don't want to harm nobody, ef we kin
help it, so you mind what ye've been told
and ye won't git hurt."</p>

<p>"Who is your captain?" inquired the
engineer.</p>

<p>"Captain Joaquin."</p>

<p>"The deuce you say! That settles it,
Tom," to the fireman. "We had better
keep right on reachin' skyward."</p>

<p>"Et won't be healthy fur ye ef ye
don't," they were again warned. "Captain
Joaquin is after the funds of the
Castleville Bank, and he is bound to have
'em at any cost."</p>

<p>"The Castleville National Bank?"</p>

<p>"Jist so."</p>

<p>"What have we got to do with the
funds of the bank? Does he think they
are in the express safe to-day?"</p>

<p>"He don't think it; he knows it."</p>

<p>"But, he is dreaming. What would
the bank's funds be on our train for?"</p>

<p>"The bank has closed up its business,
to take effect at noon to-day, and the
capital is on its way to San Francisco.
But, it will never get thar."</p>

<p>Perhaps the engineer and fireman did
not notice it, but the Western twang and
mannerism of this man's speech were
forced; it was evident that his natural
speech was correct&mdash;that he was no border
tough.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess nobody knew it," the
engineer commented.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; Captain Joaquin knew of it,"
assured the man, with a light laugh.</p>

<p>No more was then said, the engineer
and fireman giving their attention to
what was going on at the express car.</p>

<p>The messenger had refused to open
the door when ordered to do so, and had
already killed one man and wounded another,
firing through the barred ventilator
close up under the roof.</p>

<p>The robbers were preparing to use
dynamite.</p>

<p>Back in the cars the others were holding
up the passengers, but without any
attempt at robbing them.</p>

<p>This, of itself, was proof that the express
car was the objective point; they
meant to risk nothing by attempting to
make the robbery general.</p>

<p>By some accident, or by some passenger
daring all to take the initiative, the
robbers might lose control in one of the
cars, and if that happened, and they
kept the people in the cars together,
they might be successful in beating the
robbers off.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one man standing
just within each door, with a cocked and
leveled Winchester in hand, and his finger
on the trigger, they had all the advantage
in their favor, and might hold
it as long as they desired.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood in the coaches,
while events in the vicinity of the express
car were coming to a climax.</p>

<p>Among the travelers in the smoking-car
was one whom we must notice. About
thirty years of age, he had keen, dark
eyes, and hair that partook of the same
shade and fell in a wave upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>He had a graceful mustache, and his
regular features made him rather more
than passably good-looking.</p>

<p>He was simply, almost roughly, clad.</p>

<p>At the first sound of the whistle he had
started up, and had seemed to take an
interest.</p>

<p>At the next alarm a couple of guns
sprang to his hands, and he called on the
others in the smoker with him to prepare
for a possible attempt at robbery.</p>

<p>There were, perhaps, a score of men
in that car.</p>

<p>Some of them drew guns, but when
the train stopped and the masked men
with their Winchesters appeared, the
sight took all the bravery out of them.</p>

<p>The young man we have described,
like the others, after a hasty look around
to see what the others were doing, raised
his hands, but the weapons remained
close beside him on the cushion.</p>

<p>They were not allowed to leave their
seats; all that was required of them was
to sit still and keep their hands in sight.</p>

<p>This they did.</p>

<p>But there was a grim look on the face
of the man described, as if he wanted
only half an opportunity to act.</p>

<p>In all the cars the situation was the
same, and presently to their ears came
the sound of an explosion that could be
felt as well as heard. The express car
had been blown open.</p>

<p>Immediately following the explosion
the report of a pistol rang out in the
smoker, and the robber nearest the rear
door dropped in his tracks. Another, and
the one in front dropped his rifle and uttered
a howl of pain, and all the men in
the car looked in astonishment.</p>

<p>There stood the man we have mentioned,
with both of his weapons in his
grasp. So lightning quick had he acted
that no one had detected him in the act
until the shots were fired.</p>

<p>But he did not remain inactive.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he called out to the
others. "Back me up, and we will beat
them off and cheat them yet. We are
ten to their one, and they'll be too rattled
to shoot straight."</p>

<p>He ran for the rear door, even while
speaking, and some three or four made
bold to follow him, with pistol in hand,
but for the most part they hung back
like cowards. Straight to that door, and
out, and into the next car, where two
more of the robbers were stationed.</p>

<p>Opening the door suddenly, this man
clapped his revolver behind the ear of
one of these, and commanded him to
drop his gun, which, at the touch of the
cold tube, the fellow promptly did. The
other, however, at the other end of the
car, brought his rifle up to his shoulder
and gave warning that he was going to
fire.</p>

<p>Before he could do so, however, for it
required aim to avoid hitting his comrade,
the traveler had thrown one arm
around the neck of the robber he had
disarmed, and, in a twinkling, let fly
a snap shot from behind that living barricade
and placed the fellow at the other
end of the car hors de combat. The passengers
sprang to their feet with a cheer,
and it looked as if they were going to
get the upper hand.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DICK'S FRUITLESS RISK.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick, Junior!</p>

<p>He it was who had, at the risk of his
life, made this break to cheat the train-robbers.</p>

<p>"Follow me, every man of you who has
a gun!" he called out to them. "We can
do these fellows up in short order, if we
go for them in the right manner. Who is
with me?"</p>

<p>There was another cheer at that.</p>

<p>"We're with you to a man!" some one
shouted. "You lead the way, and see if
we ain't."</p>

<p>"All right! Follow me, but if I go down,
don't let that check you; go right on and
you will run clear over them by force of
numbers. Now, then, here we go for
them!"</p>

<p>With that, Dick dashed out of the doors
and leaped to the ground, his brace of
revolvers in hand ready to do execution.</p>

<p>He began firing the moment he touched
the ground.</p>

<p>Two other fellows had followed, but,
at the return fire from the outlaws, one
of these fell dead and the other lost the
use of an arm by a bullet.</p>

<p>Dick himself had the closest kind of
a call, a bullet zipping past his face so
close that he felt it touch his skin, taking
away a strand of his long hair in its
flight.</p>

<p>But that did not stop him even for an
instant. Two men had already gone down
before him, and now a third, and, had
he been supported, the victory would
have been easy; but those who had
cheered the loudest were the first to
draw back, when they saw the others
drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>They hesitated, drew back, and then
dived into the cars again as if it were
raining bullets without, and dauntless
Dick Bristol was left entirely alone and
unsupported.</p>

<p>Hearing the outlaws yell, Dick looked
back and realized his position.</p>

<p>Without turning to look the other way
again, for that would have been to lose
a fraction of a second of opportunity, he
dropped to the ground and almost the
same instant came the sharp crack of
three or four rifles.</p>

<p>For a moment there he lay; then his revolvers
cracked, bringing out at least one
cry of pain. Again he was on his feet,
dashing for the nearest car. Once more
he dropped, not because he saw any one
aiming at him, but because he knew they
had had just time to do so.</p>

<p>Very true guess, for the rifles spoke
out, and again he had escaped their bullets.</p>

<p>Upon the instant, another leap carried
him to the platform, and for the
time being he was safe.</p>

<p>"Curse you for the cowards you are!"
he cried, facing his fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>"Why did you not back me up as you
promised? We had them dead to rights
then, had you but done your part!"</p>

<p>"And they would now have us dead,"
argued one of the timid ones, "the same
as that poor fellow they did drop."</p>

<p>"And whose death counts for nothing,
because you did not take advantage of
the moment," retorted Dick, hotly.</p>

<p>Dick Bristol was disgusted.</p>

<p>Outside the cars, now, at a sufficient
distance to command a good view, men
were watching for the appearance of a
head.</p>

<p>The same trick could not be repeated;
the advantage once lost was lost for good
and all, and Fighting Dick's chagrin was
great to think that he had risked so much
and gained so little.</p>

<p>"And for whose death you are responsible,"
rejoined the one who had spoken
before.</p>

<p>"Not so much as are you," cried Dick.</p>

<p>"It was not I who led the foolhardy attack,"
the retort.</p>

<p>"We are all well aware of that,"
sneered Dick. "You were too much a
coward even to follow."</p>

<p>"You mean I had too much good
sense."</p>

<p>"I mean what I said."</p>

<p>"Then you lie!"</p>

<p>Smack!</p>

<p>That man was stretched his full length
the same instant.</p>

<p>"A little too much, that, when I risked
my life to lead you to an attack that
would have been a success if you had
only supported me. There is no good reason
why those fellows should not be our
prisoners this minute!"</p>

<p>No one else ventured to dispute the
point, and the fellow Dick had floored
got slowly up, nursing an injured eye,
and went muttering to a seat and sat
down, while Dick paced up and down the
car aisle, like a caged tiger. For a leader
so intrepid, the defeat was crushing.</p>

<p>In the mean time the looting of the express-car
had been successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>The car was a strong one, built without
end doors, and calculated to withstand
a severe siege, but it was not, of
course, proof against dynamite.</p>

<p>The messenger had made a good defense,
but, after the explosion, which
shattered the side door and made a huge
rent in the side of the car, it was found
that he had been killed by a piece of
the flying iron.</p>

<p>"Served him right!" cried Captain
Joaquin. "If he had opened the door in
the first place we wouldn't 'a' harmed
him."</p>

<p>"They will never learn sense," from
one of his men.</p>

<p>"He never will; that's certain."</p>

<p>They bounded into the car, a sledge
was used to open the safe, and therein
was found the treasure they were after.</p>

<p>There were several packages of bills,
each marked $10,000, and each securely
tied and sealed. These Captain Joaquin
seized upon immediately, and crammed
into a bag which hung by a strap from
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked his men.</p>

<p>"Don't see anything more, do you?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Not here; but the passengers may
pan out well if we run 'em through the
mill."</p>

<p>"To Hades with the passengers! What
do we want with them after this rich
haul? But, hold on! There is one of
them that I want and must have."</p>

<p>"You want a particular passenger?"
demanded one of the men, in amaze.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want but one particular person."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"The fellow who killed Charlie and
Bill, and almost stampeded the train. I
know him, and he shall pay dearly for it.
Besides, he is a chap that we want out
of our way, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Why, who is he, captain?"</p>

<p>"Only Deadwood Dick, Junior, is all."</p>

<p>"Deadwood Dick!"</p>

<p>The little that could be seen of their
faces, beneath their masks, proved that
more than one of them went pale on
hearing that name spoken.</p>

<p>"Nobody else, and he is our mutton
now, and we'll make him the sickest man
in seven counties before we get done
with him. He has been after us long
enough; now we'll hunt the man-hunter
to his doom."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that is the talk, captain!"</p>

<p>The captain leaped out of the car, the
others after him, and Captain Joaquin
shouted to the men on the engine:</p>

<p>"Hold those two fellows under strict
cover, boys, until I give you the word;
then get down and let them go. I'll be
done in a minute, now; soon as I get a
man."</p>

<p>"All right, captain!"</p>

<p>"Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>The leader ran in the direction of the
smoker, the others at his heels, save
those who were standing guard around
the train, and leaping up the steps he
boldly entered.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick was sitting sullenly in
his seat, having deposited his valuables
in the legs of his boots, and would not
lift a finger to defend the passengers
who had failed to support him at the
critical moment.</p>

<p>He did not know what was coming,
else he could have picked Captain Joaquin
off easily as he entered the door.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>His own revolver and half a dozen
more over his shoulders covered the
whole company.</p>

<p>Up went their hands, Deadwood Dick's
among the rest, and all expected the
usual course of proceedings to follow;
but in that they were mistaken.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, gentlemen," called
out the leader. "I don't want your tin
this time; I am after the chap who led
the insurrection in this car awhile ago.
Deadwood Dick, Junior, rise up and surrender,
or we will fill you full of lead
where you sit! Take your choice."</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CAPTAIN JOAQUIN'S CAPTURE.</p>


<p>"Deadwood Dick, Junior!"</p>

<p>The name was upon the lips of all
the passengers, instantly.</p>

<p>They looked in Dick's direction, as he
rose up as ordered, and the look on
their faces would be hard to describe.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" responded Dick, in his
firm manner. "If these passengers are
willing to let you take me, so be it; I
shall not kick. Better that I should
surrender than that any one should get
hurt, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Some one would get hurt if you
didn't surrender, that is a certainty,"
Captain Joaquin declared.</p>

<p>The passengers were pale, and no one
offered to defend the gallant Richard of
the Lion Heart.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am."</p>

<p>Dick was as cool as Captain Joaquin
himself, and stood awaiting the pleasure
of that notorious outlaw.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to have a pair of
handcuffs with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a couple of pairs."</p>

<p>"One will answer the purpose. Let's
have 'em, and one of my men will see
how they will fit you."</p>

<p>"Just a word first."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing with me?"</p>

<p>"That is something you will learn all
in good time. Come! the handcuffs!"</p>

<p>"If it is your intention to kill me, I
may as well die right here as anywhere;
if you intend to give me a chance for
my life, all right."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot here!" called out a timid
passenger.</p>

<p>"It would be a good thing to do a
little of it for your especial benefit,"
Dick declared ironically.</p>

<p>"No, don't resist, but go with 'em
peaceably," the passenger urged. "It
is better that one should make a sacrifice
than that all should come to grief,"
he argued.</p>

<p>Dick and Captain Joaquin laughed.</p>

<p>"I intend to give you a show," said
the latter. "Come, there is no time to
fool away!"</p>

<p>Dick Bristol saw that there was only
one chance for him. He knew that to
hesitate ten seconds would mean his
death. He was in a death-trap, and the
dead-fall was ready to be sprung at a
touch.</p>

<p>"All right; here you are!" he said,
lowering his left hand, and thrusting it
into his jacket pocket, he produced the
required article. "Shall I put 'em on
myself, or will you come and attend to
that?"</p>

<p>"Put 'em on," said the captain. "I'll
undertake to see that they are secure
after that."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>There was a click, and Deadwood
Dick stood handcuffed.</p>

<p>If only that car had contained half a
dozen such men as he often had around
him as allies!</p>

<p>As it was there was not a saving
hand&mdash;not a single spirit brave enough
to attempt his defense; and it was just
as well, for had there been one such,
he would have been unsupported; it
would have been a needless sacrifice of a
brave man.</p>

<p>"Now, then, come this way!" Captain
Joaquin ordered. "Have you got
any baggage aboard?"</p>

<p>"Not an ounce."</p>

<p>"All the better."</p>

<p>Dick advanced, as ordered, and way
was made for him to pass out, the outlaws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
still covering the passengers with
their guns.</p>

<p>One of their number laid a hand on
Dick as he passed, and went with him,
while the others backed away from the
door, their revolvers still to the front,
and sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin sounded a whistle.</p>

<p>His men backed away from the train
with him, their Winchesters and revolvers
ready for instant service.</p>

<p>When they had withdrawn to the distance
of several yards, the captain
shouted to the engineer to go ahead, but
the conductor swung his arm and countermanded
the order.</p>

<p>He and the trainmen had been held up
in a group by themselves while the robbers
were doing their work.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" cried
the Red Rover.</p>

<p>That, by the way, was a name by which
the outlaw was fully as well known as
by his appellation of Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"That express-car is the matter," was
the answer. "You can't expect me to
risk the lives of my passengers by starting
before I see whether it is fit to run
or not."</p>

<p>"It will hang together until you get
to the next station, if you are careful,
and that is all you want. Go ahead!" to
the engineer. "If you don't, we will riddle
you with bullets and start your train
ourselves and run you straight to
Satan!"</p>

<p>That settled it. The moment they
turned their guns upon the engineer he
blew the signal to go ahead, and pulled
the throttle.</p>

<p>Finding that the express-car was on
its trucks all right, and that it would run,
he pulled the throttle again, and there
was nothing for the conductor and trainmen
to do but jump aboard.</p>

<p>The band of outlaws gave them a parting
cheer, swinging their hats until the
train rounded the next bend and passed
out of sight.</p>

<p>The dead, we have forgotten to mention,
had been thrown into the express-car.</p>

<p>The wounded outlaws were hurriedly
cared for while the horses were brought.</p>

<p>Scarce ten minutes had been occupied,
all together, and in two or three minutes
after the departure of the train the
robbers were wending their way into the
mountains.</p>

<p>It had been one of Captain Joaquin's
most daring raids, and at the same time
one of his most successful; certainly it
had brought him more than he had
counted upon.</p>

<p>And, besides, Deadwood Dick&mdash;whom
he had feared if he feared any man&mdash;was
his prisoner!</p>

<p>That was, after all, his biggest haul,
and he breathed easier.</p>

<p>He had known for some time, or had,
with good reason, believed that the
prince of detectives was on his trail, and
his vigilance thus had been severely
taxed. Now he had this terrible outlaw
and crook-hunter corralled; that was
glory enough for one year!</p>

<p>"Well, Deadwood Dick, I have got you
at last," he remarked, as they rode along.</p>

<p>"Yes, so it appears. You have been
looking for me, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, we have been looking for you,
yes."</p>

<p>"And what do you intend to do with
me, now that you have got me? On your
word that you would give me a fair show,
I placed these handcuffs on my wrists,
as you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have not tried them yet,
as I promised to do, by the way. Here,
Jim, just see if this fellow's irons are
safe."</p>

<p>One of the men rode forward and tried
them.</p>

<p>"He can't git out of them 'ar things,
cap'n," he reported.</p>

<p>"All right. It seems you put them on
to stay, Deadwood Dick. You have the
key to them, of course."</p>

<p>"In my vest pocket."</p>

<p>"All right. Just relieve him of it,
Jim."</p>

<p>"You bet, boss! We don't want him
springin' no tricks on us, hey?"</p>

<p>The outlaw thrust his fingers into
Dick's pocket and brought forth a small
key, handing it to Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"Not much of a trick I could spring on
you, my good fellow," observed Dick. "If
you tried it, you would find that you
could not unlock the bracelets to save
your life, even with the key in your fingers."</p>

<p>"Ther doose I couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Not if they were on your own wrists,
no."</p>

<p>"All the same, I will retain the key,"
assured the Red Rover.</p>

<p>"And what kind of a fair show do you
intend to give me?" again demanded the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"What kind of a show do you want?"</p>

<p>"Just a chance for my life, that is all."</p>

<p>"You picked off two or three of our
men, though," one complained.</p>

<p>"And you killed about as many of
ours, so that account ought to stand
squared," argued Bristol.</p>

<p>"Well, call it square," rejoined Captain
Joaquin. "I said I would give you a
show, and I will. How would you like
to become one of us?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">REJECTING A PROPOSAL.</p>


<p>Dick Bristol smiled grimly.</p>

<p>He knew that Captain Joaquin was no
fool, and also that the outlaw did not
take him to be one.</p>

<p>Was this the chance for his life the
road-raider intended to give him? It
looked so. Dick could plainly see the
string attached to the gift.</p>

<p>He did not respond immediately.</p>

<p>"You don't answer," urged the Red
Rover.</p>

<p>"What is the use? Were I to accept,
all in good faith, you would not trust
me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I am Deadwood Dick, the
Dead-Set Detective and Rogue-Runner."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin smiled in his turn.</p>

<p>He and his men had now removed
their masks.</p>

<p>"That is a good enough reason, certainly,"
he said.</p>

<p>"And that is the only show you intend
to give me?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do? I will give you
an equal share with the rest of my men
of the plunder we have taken to-day,
according to the rate I divide with them,
and make you one of us. I can't do any
more than that."</p>

<p>"There is no use our trying to fool
each other, Captain Joaquin."</p>

<p>"Then you don't believe that I will
do what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you will do that, if I
say I will accept the proposition."</p>

<p>"Then what is the matter with your
accepting it? You would make a fine
lieutenant for me, now that poor Hoxey
is dead&mdash;thanks to that express-messenger."</p>

<p>"I had rather deal openly with you
then underhanded, Red Rover," was
Dick's response.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what you know&mdash;that I am first,
last and all the time against birds of your
feather, and that were I to accept your
offer it would be only to do you a trick
at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>A murmur of admiration ran through
the company of cutthroats.</p>

<p>"That being the case, I must recall
the offer, that's all. I have no way of
convincing you that I meant it in good
faith."</p>

<p>"No, you would find it impossible to
do that."</p>

<p>"Well, I have given you the show I
promised."</p>

<p>"And it was about what I expected, at
your hands. You have got me; you mean
to do away with me. Well, I do not
blame you for that."</p>

<p>"Thunder! but you are a brave cuss,
Dick Bristol! What a team you and I
would make, if we could only have confidence
in each other and work together!
But, that is out of the question."</p>

<p>"Entirely out of the question."</p>

<p>"Then, what can you propose?"</p>

<p>"Let me go, and I pledge you my word
not to move against you for a period of
ten days, you to observe the same armistice."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"War to the knife again!"</p>

<p>"I hope you do not take me for a fool."</p>

<p>"Not at all, save only that all villains
are fools in that they go wrong instead
of right."</p>

<p>"Have a care, Bristol! Some word of
yours may cost your life without a moment's
notice. I am not the man to
brook many such insults. I give you
warning."</p>

<p>"Neither are you a coward, Red Rover.
You would not shoot me down handcuffed
as I am."</p>

<p>Again a murmur ran through the band.</p>

<p>"You have nothing more to propose?"</p>

<p>"No; I considered that proposition a
sort of even exchange; that was all."</p>

<p>"An exchange? Where does the exchange
come in, I would like to know? I
do not see that I would be getting anything
out of it."</p>

<p>"It would be giving me my life for
yours. I could have picked you off easily
when you entered that car after me, but
spared you."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Lucky for you you didn't do
that; you would have been a dead man
the same instant."</p>

<p>"And you would have been just as
dead, for I seldom miss my mark when
I take a bead on a man."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you shoot me?
Come, now, why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Because I knew it would cost the
lives of the others in the car, who hadn't
the nerve to follow where I led, on the
first occasion. It would have been much
easier to have shot you than it was to
take those two fellows who already had
the drop on the car."</p>

<p>"Well, that cuts no ice with me, since
you didn't spare me for any love you
have for me. There is really no reason
why I should spare you, that I can see."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Then what are you kicking about?"</p>

<p>"All I am asking is a fair chance.
When I put on these handcuffs I had
your word that I would get that."</p>

<p>"And I have given it and you have
refused it. I can do nothing more than
that. It has been war to the knife between
us, as you expressed it, and I have
won the fight. I would be a fool to give
up the advantage gained."</p>

<p>"Just as you have a mind to look at
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose you had captured me, would
you let me go again?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then say no more about it. Neither
can I let you go. I would be a fool if I
did."</p>

<p>"Well, I have to agree with you, Captain
Joaquin. As I said before, there is
no use in our trying to fool each other.
We are foes to the bitter end, and so be
it."</p>

<p>The outlaw gave a nod and a wave of
the hand in acquiescence, and which, at
the same time, cut the subject short.</p>

<p>A little later he called a halt.</p>

<p>"Here, men," he said, "is the place for
us to part company. You know what the
programme is."</p>

<p>They answered that they did.</p>

<p>"You, Hurley, I will make my lieutenant
in place of Hoxey. Take the men on
at speed to Injun Ford, and there divide
your force, half going up the creek and
half down. Part by twos, and scatter to
every point of the compass until the time
of meeting, as agreed."</p>

<p>"All right; we understand," answered
Hurley.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin dismounted.</p>

<p>"But, what about ther prisoner?" his
lieutenant inquired. "What are we goin'
to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Hang me if I know," responded the
Red Rover, rubbing his chin in a meditative
manner.</p>

<p>"Jist whatever you say, captain," assured
Hurley.</p>

<p>"I am afraid to trust him with you,
boys," decided Captain Joaquin, after a
few moments' reflection. "He would be
sure to find the soft spot in your hearts,
if you have got such organs, and play
upon it. I guess I will take him with me.
Dismount, Deadwood Dick!"</p>

<p>"And be murdered in cold blood somewhere
in the mountain passes?"</p>

<p>"You will be shot here and now if you
don't."</p>

<p>"Well, it is about as broad as it is
long," observed Dick, throwing his leg
over and leaping lightly to the ground.
"You hold the winning card, captain."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I intend to play it for all
there is in it, too," was the rejoinder.
"Come, boys, off with you, and make all
the time you can, for the sheriff and his
posse will be on your trail in less than
two hours."</p>

<p>"And let him catch us if he can!"
cried Hurley, as he touched his horse and
led the way, the riderless horses being
led.</p>

<p>The others cheered as they followed,
and as soon as they had passed out of
sight, Captain Joaquin turned to Dick
and said:</p>

<p>"Now, then, Deadwood Dick, you follow
me."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TURNING THE TABLES.</p>


<p>Captain Joaquin met with the surprise
of his life, just there!</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick's hands came up to the
level, the handcuffs swinging by one
wrist, and in each hand a gun!</p>

<p>"I prefer to have you follow me, Red
Rover!" Dick said grimly. "If you make
a move or a sound you are a dead man
in the same instant, I give you fair warning."</p>

<p>The outlaw turned as white as chalk.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he hissed. "You have
tricked me, after all!"</p>

<p>"Everything is fair in love and war,"
with a smile. "You are my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Cursed idiot that I was for not hanging
you to the first tree we came to! But,
do you not mean to give me a show?"</p>

<p>"About as much of a show as you gave
me, perhaps."</p>

<p>"You have got me; I own the corn.
But let us come to some sort of terms.
I have got about seventy thousand dollars
here in this bag; I'll divide even with
you and each go his way."</p>

<p>"What is the use of dividing, when I
can have it all if I want to take it?"</p>

<p>"Do not be too sure of that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold! I read your thought in your
eyes, my man. If you make a move to
get a gun you will die before you can say
scat! Dick Bristol seldom misses his
mark."</p>

<p>"Curse you! But before you shall have
this wealth you shall murder me to get
it; I will defend it with my life."</p>

<p>"I do not want it; that is, I want you
and it together."</p>

<p>"Then you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To hand you over to the authorities,
yes, and restore the funds to their
owner."</p>

<p>"You are a fool! Here is a life-time
fortune within reach of your hand, Deadwood
Dick, and if you do as you say you
will not get more than five thousand, at
the most, for your risk and trouble."</p>

<p>"That is your way of looking at it."</p>

<p>"My way of looking at it, yes."</p>

<p>"And you will not accept my proposition?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly not."</p>

<p>"Then I have another to make."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"First let us draw back from this trail.
I took leave of my men here in order to
get away safely with the boodle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which I do not mean that you shall
do, so I prefer to remain close to the
trail. The sheriff's posse will pass this
way as soon as a special engine can be
run to the scene of your robbery."</p>

<p>"And you will turn me over to them?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"I will not be alive."</p>

<p>"That will be your fault, then. You
will be worth just as much to them."</p>

<p>"Well, for my proposition&mdash;are you
open to anything that I might suggest?
I made you a fair offer, when I held the
better hand."</p>

<p>"An offer that you did not mean, however."</p>

<p>"I swear that I did mean it."</p>

<p>"I have only your word for that."</p>

<p>"And my word is all I have to give
you."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that you, knowing
who I am, really would have entered
into a compact with me and taken me
into your band?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I do tell you&mdash;just
what I did mean. You would not have it
so, and there was an end of it. I gave
you a fair show, the same as I said I
would."</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"I want a fair show in return."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll give it to you, as far as I
can. What is your suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Give me yours first. Perhaps it is
something that we can agree upon, and,
if so, no need to mention mine."</p>

<p>"Well, you undertake to aid me in taking
this money safe to its destination,
and I will use my influence with the governor
for a pardon for you and make you
my detective ally."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"You will not listen to it, eh! Well, it
is all I can offer you, and is on a par
with the offer you made me."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, just as impossible as
the offer I made you&mdash;yes, a good deal
more so. The governor has a rope ready
for me, and he will use it at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>"Well, what is your proposition,
then?"</p>

<p>"That we decide this matter by a fair
and square duel to the death."</p>

<p>"Which is a rather cool thing to ask
of an officer of the law, after he has
bagged his game."</p>

<p>"Then you will not do it?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Because I was in earnest in the offer
I made you when you were my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Captain Joaquin, I don't believe it.
You are not such a fool as to make such
a proposition to me in earnest, knowing
who I am. Or, if you did mean it, there
was a purpose behind it."</p>

<p>"My purpose was to make you my
friend instead of my foe."</p>

<p>"I believe that you lie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I cannot convince you, that is
certain. What are you going to do with
me?"</p>

<p>"I say I believe that you lie, but giving
you the benefit of the doubt, and giving
you half a chance for your life, I will
accept your proposition."</p>

<p>"You will take half and let me go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, not that; I will fight you to
the death, the best man to win. We'll
see whether chance will be on the side
of the law or the lawless."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"You are surprised?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You take me for a fool, I know, and
so I am for giving you such a chance;
but there is the bare possibility that you
are telling the truth concerning the
chance you would have given me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I swear that I was telling
the truth&mdash;that I did&mdash;that I am telling
the truth!"</p>

<p>"Very well, I give you the benefit of
the doubt."</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick believed that the fellow
was lying, nevertheless, and so, in
fact, he was. Seeing a chance to gain the
point, he played upon the string to the
limit.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you, but I will do as
I say," said Dick. "Put down that bag
of money, and go away twenty paces and
draw your guns."</p>

<p>"Ha! there is something else to be
thought of."</p>

<p>"What is that? Don't forget, mean
time, that I hold the drop, and that the
slightest suspicious move on your part
will mean your death, which will naturally
culminate all negotiations."</p>

<p>"I am not rash enough to try any
trick with you, Deadwood Dick. I am too
eager to accept the one chance in a
thousand that you hold out to me. What
I was going to say&mdash;suppose we both get
disabled, what of the money in that
event? Some one who has no right to it
will come along and gather it in."</p>

<p>"What do you propose respecting it,
then?"</p>

<p>"That we go and cache it first of all."</p>

<p>"Very well, that is not a bad idea. It
will be safe for you or for me, whichever
has use for it after our duel."</p>

<p>"Just so. I know a fine place for it,
where it will keep for ten days or ten
years; just as the case may be, and
where no one will ever find it in the
world."</p>

<p>"There is one objection to that, however."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"That we may both be killed outright,
and the money will never be recovered."</p>

<p>"We'll have to take the chances of
that. Come, we must do something, for
we are wasting precious time&mdash;at any
rate, I am. Every minute I stay here I
am one minute nearer prison doors."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CACHING THE TREASURE.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick had to laugh.</p>

<p>There was something about the situation
that struck him as being ridiculous.</p>

<p>Why should he be talking terms and
conditions to a man already in his power,
and that man an outlaw? It was needless,
and yet&mdash;Well, Deadwood Dick had
his moods.</p>

<p>He was willing to give the fellow, rascal
though he was, the benefit of a doubt,
and now that his word had been given
he would not recall it. That was not
Deadwood Dick's way. What he said,
that had to stand; and yet, as said, he
had to laugh.</p>

<p>"As if you are not as good as in prison
already," he said. "Still, I have given
my word, and I'll stick to it. Pace off
the required number of steps backward,
then draw your guns, and at the word
from me open fire, and do your best to
dispose of me. If you miss the first shot
I warn you that you are not likely to get
a second."</p>

<p>"But, the money?"</p>

<p>"Take it with you; I can pick it up
after I have dropped you. If I happen to
be the one to go down, you will not have
to stop."</p>

<p>"No, no, we must not risk that, Deadwood
Dick. Recall what I said a moment
ago. If you are going to give me a show
at all, let it be a fair one all around."</p>

<p>"Then you are determined to cache
it?"</p>

<p>"I want to."</p>

<p>"That will mean a delay while you
draw two maps of the spot where it is
cached, one for me and the other for you.
If we both go down, others can then find
and profit by it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that. I can't expect to
have it all my own way."</p>

<p>"All right. First of all, turn your back
to me and remove your weapons, and lay
them on the ground."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Because I will not risk a snap shot
from you when you might possibly get a
chance to fire it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't kick. You are the fiddler,
just now, and I have got to dance
to your tune. If the tables turn again,
however, you will dance to mine, I warn
you."</p>

<p>"Should the tables turn, you will have
a chance to deal as honorably with me as
I have done with you."</p>

<p>"And I'll do it, too."</p>

<p>The outlaw turned the other way,
Dick's precaution against a snap shot,
while he was removing his weapons, and
in a moment was disarmed. His rifle, a
brace of revolvers, and a knife lay on
the ground.</p>

<p>"These things are not to be left here,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," answered Dick; "I
will bring them along with me. Go ahead,
now, to the place where you want to hide
the money."</p>

<p>"All right, follow me. I will take you
to a place that is known only to myself."</p>

<p>He started off.</p>

<p>Dick, having gathered up the weapons,
followed.</p>

<p>He held his man under cover, and it
would have been impossible for him to
escape.</p>

<p>Straight up into the mountain fastness,
for a mile, the outlaw led the way, and
they left no trail that could possibly have
been followed save possibly by a bloodhound.</p>

<p>If it has seemed that Deadwood Dick
was acting unwisely, and was assuming
too great risks, it was not altogether
without some compensating objects in
view. He wanted to learn some of the
secrets of this Red Rover who had become
a terror in the State.</p>

<p>Finally, on a plateau on the very summit
of a low peak, Captain Joaquin
stopped.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said.</p>

<p>It was a scene of wildest grandeur.</p>

<p>On every hand higher peaks rose and
overshadowed the one on which they
stood.</p>

<p>There was but one approach to the plateau,
the way they had come. Every
other side presented a sheer descent
that could not be scaled.</p>

<p>Just back from the place where they
had stepped up onto the rock table was
a depression in which lay a boulder that
was seemingly loose and possibly movable.</p>

<p>"And your cache is under that boulder?"
asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes, there. You were quick to guess
it&mdash;But, then, there is no other place
possible."</p>

<p>"Hence it was not a guess, but a conclusion.
Well, deposit your plunder and
let us settle our business."</p>

<p>"Yes, in short order."</p>

<p>The outlaw chieftain put his shoulder
to the boulder, at a certain point, and
began surging his weight against it, and
presently it moved.</p>

<p>He increased the force, it moved more
and a little more, till presently it rolled
over to another point of support, revealing
a hole in the table under where it
had rested.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said.</p>

<p>"Any treasure there now?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>"No, not a bit; look and see for yourself."</p>

<p>"It does not matter."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin took the bag from his
shoulder and tossed it into the cavity,
strap and all, and going around to the
other side of the boulder, turned it back
into place.</p>

<p>"Now for the key-maps to the hiding-place,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"That is going to a good deal of
trouble."</p>

<p>"All on your account."</p>

<p>The outlaw smiled, and took paper and
pencil from his pocket.</p>

<p>Spreading the paper upon the side of
the boulder where a flat surface was presented,
he began to sketch a map.</p>

<p>It took him several minutes, and when
it was done he proceeded to make a duplicate
of it. Both done, he held them up
for Deadwood Dick's inspection.</p>

<p>"There you are," he said. "You can
see for yourself that I have made them
correct. Here is the main trail, this is
the way we came, and here is the little
peak on which we are standing. Here I
have made an index, and under it written&mdash;Turn
the boulder."</p>

<p>"That is good enough," said Dick,
"but just write&mdash;Here treasure is hidden."</p>

<p>"All right, as you desire."</p>

<p>The words were written, and one of the
maps was handed to Dick.</p>

<p>Dick put it into his pocket, Captain
Joaquin doing the same with his copy,
and they were ready.</p>

<p>"Now for business," said the Red
Rover.</p>

<p>"Yes, now to oblige you," said Dick.
"Where is the fight to take place?"</p>

<p>"Just down there where the straight
stretch of gulch lies, where we can have
a clear and fair range, with nothing in
the way."</p>

<p>"I prefer to go out to the gulch from
which this one branches," said Dick. "I
take it that one is traveled, while this
one is seldom entered save by you yourself."</p>

<p>"What's your reason for that?"</p>

<p>"We want our bodies to be found, if
we both get hit hard."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't quarrel with your plan.
Come on and let's have it over and done
with."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin led the way down
from the little peak, Dick following close
behind him, and through the first gulch
mentioned out to the one Dick had preferred.</p>

<p>"This will do," said Dick. "I do not
want to have too far to walk back to get
the treasure. Here are your weapons,"
laying them on the ground as he spoke;
"take them and back off the required
distance, and we will begin to perforate
each other. The man who strikes the
ticker first, wins. Remember what I told
you about the first shot."</p>

<p>"I'll try to make it unnecessary to fire
more than one," said the outlaw, with a
sardonic smile, as he picked up his
weapons.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SECRET SHOT.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick smiled too, in a grim
fashion.</p>

<p>While fate might be against him, yet it
was his intention to shoot Captain Joaquin
so dead that he would never kick
again.</p>

<p>It was a trying moment for both men.</p>

<p>With Dick it was like bantering Providence,
while with the Red Rover it was
a last desperate chance, like one in a
thousand. With both it was a moment to
test their nerves.</p>

<p>That neither was a coward needs no
attesting.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin measured off twenty
paces, walking with his back to Dick
and trusting him fully.</p>

<p>Perhaps he felt that he could trust to
the honor of a man who would thus give
him a chance for his life after having
caught him and made him prisoner.</p>

<p>Not only was Dick doing that, but he
was running the risk of his own life by
so doing. He was making it an even toss
between right and wrong, between law
and outlaw, between justice and iniquity.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin stopped and faced
around.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he coolly asked.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Dick.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I do not want to take any advantage
of you, nor do I mean to allow you to
take any advantage of me if I can help
it."</p>

<p>"That is right."</p>

<p>"We must have a signal to fire by,
and it must be one that neither of us
can mistake."</p>

<p>"I agree with you there. What shall it
be?"</p>

<p>"If we had some one here to count
three for us, that would do, but seeing
that we have not, we cannot do it for
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The one who counted would have just
the shade of an advantage over the
other."</p>

<p>"He should not take it."</p>

<p>"If he hesitated, the other fellow
would have it."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"If I count, I can say three and shoot
at the same moment, while it would take
a fraction of a second for you to hear
and shoot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's something in that, I guess."</p>

<p>"Now, what I propose is this: We will
count up to ten, in unison, keeping perfect
time, hands straight down at the
sides, and at the word ten we will fire."</p>

<p>"I can't find any fault with that."</p>

<p>"It is as fair as we can make it. Are
your weapons in order?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and yours?"</p>

<p>"The same. Place yourself in position."</p>

<p>The outlaw had laid his Winchester on
the ground, and with a revolver in each
hand, he stood erect, hands at his sides.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick was already in that position,
for the agreement had so far
progressed that it seemed useless for him
to hold the Red Rover under cover when
the end was so near.</p>

<p>"Now," said Dick, "count with me,
and by the time we reach six or seven it
will sound as one voice. Remember,
neither is to lift an arm until ten is
heard; then you may shoot just as quick
as you can. Are you all ready to begin?
I don't want to hurry you."</p>

<p>"I am all ready; let her go."</p>

<p>"All right, begin: One, two, three,
four," they started, and by the time four
was spoken they were in time and unison,
and it sounded as Dick had said, as
one voice. "Five, six, seven&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>The report of a rifle rang out upon the
still air.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick gave a start, partly
raised his right hand, and fell forward
on his face.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin looked around in
greatest surprise, and hesitated only a
moment before he sprang to the cover
of a huge boulder that lay near at hand.</p>

<p>Evidently he did not want a dose of the
same medicine.</p>

<p>A laugh rang out, the laugh of a woman,
and a young woman made her appearance
from the point where the rifle
had been fired.</p>

<p>She was fair-looking, clad in a bright
jacket, short skirt and a sombrero, her
feet incased in stout shoes and leggings.
She had a rifle in her hands.</p>

<p>At sight of her Captain Joaquin leaped
from cover.</p>

<p>"Susana!"</p>

<p>"As you see, my love!"</p>

<p>"But what have you done? Why did
you do this?"</p>

<p>"Why did I do it? Why, but to save
the life of him I love!"</p>

<p>"But, it was a fair fight; I had no right
to any advantage; he was giving me a
chance for my life."</p>

<p>"And your Susana gave you a better
chance; ha, ha, ha! But, who was he?
Some hateful sheriff, I suppose, who
would not let you mind your own business
your own way."</p>

<p>"No, it was Deadwood Dick, Junior."</p>

<p>"Heavens!"</p>

<p>The young woman started and paled.</p>

<p>"Did you not suspect that it was he,
Susana?"</p>

<p>"Not for a moment. Had I, I would
have missed him with nervousness, sure."</p>

<p>"Well, the deed is done, and we will
not cry over it now. A kiss, my pet, and
then I will show you treasure that will
make your eyes sparkle."</p>

<p>The young woman dropped the rifle
and threw herself into the man's embrace,
and their lips met. He caressed
her for a moment, then let her go and she
recovered her weapon.</p>

<p>"So, you would not take the chances,
eh?" said Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"How could I, seeing how cool and determined
he looked, and imagining you
falling forward with a bullet in your
heart&mdash;Heavens, no!"</p>

<p>"And yet it was a square deal, the
squarest I ever got in my life, Susana. If
he had killed me, it would have been a
fair game, and I could not have made a
kick when I found myself suddenly
transported."</p>

<p>The young woman laughed.</p>

<p>"You are not dying yet, though, if I
can prevent," she said. "Come, we must
see about that treasure."</p>

<p>"We must first see if you killed your
man."</p>

<p>"Killed him? He is so dead he will
never move again in this world, Joaquin."</p>

<p>"And he can well be spared, for he has
been a terror to gentlemen of my calling
all his life. Your name will be exalted,
my pet. There will be a big price
on your head."</p>

<p>"And my Joaquin will defend me."</p>

<p>"To the last drop of blood, you are
right."</p>

<p>They were walking to where Deadwood
Dick lay while talking thus.</p>

<p>As they came near they heard a slight
groan, and the young woman gave a
start and turned pale.</p>

<p>"Your shot was not so fatal, after all,"
said the Red Rover.</p>

<p>"He must be dying," said the young
woman. "I aimed carefully at his head."</p>

<p>"And succeeded finely in stunning
him. See there, you made a neat little
crease just over the temple. You will
have to finish the job."</p>

<p>"Heavens, no!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I could not do it now, since you are
out of danger; besides, he is down and
cannot help himself."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin drew a pistol and
cocked it.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried the woman, catching
his arm. "You must not, you must not!"</p>

<p>"It must be his life or mine," said the
Red Rover, grimly. "Better now, while
he is unconscious. Out of the way a
moment, Susana."</p>

<p>"No, no! You must not&mdash;you shall not!
Did you not tell me that it was a fair
fight, that he was giving you the fairest
show you ever had in your life? For
shame!"</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin flushed, and thrust
his revolver back into its holster spitefully.
He recalled the chance that Deadwood
Dick had given him for his life,
and was for the moment abashed, under
the scornful gaze of this woman who
loved him.</p>

<p>The next moment Deadwood Dick
opened his eyes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CAPTAIN JOAQUIN'S RETREAT.</p>


<p>Dick was dazed.</p>

<p>It was a moment before he could recall
what had passed.</p>

<p>When he did so, he realized that the
situation had greatly changed, and could
not tell whether minutes or hours had
passed.</p>

<p>But his mind quickly cleared, as a
magic drop will clear a glass of clouded
water, and he took in the situation and
the new-comer upon the ground, and
guessed the rest.</p>

<p>He remembered that he and his foe
had not counted up to the number that
was to have been the signal for them to
fire, and hence some one else had taken
a hand in the game. That Captain Joaquin
had not fired the treacherous shot
he was well aware.</p>

<p>The Red Rover stood motionless the
last Dick remembered of him.</p>

<p>All this passed through Dick's mind in
the few brief seconds before he spoke.</p>

<p>"So, you are alive, are you?" said
Captain Joaquin. "It was a close call
for you, Deadwood Dick."</p>

<p>"Who shot me?" asked Dick, feeling
of his hurt.</p>

<p>"No matter who," was the reply. "It
was not I, nor was it done by any order
or consent of mine. I had no thought or
intention of giving you anything but a
fair fight."</p>

<p>"I am willing to believe that. It must
have been some friend of yours, some
one who feared for your life. Well, such
is the fortune of war, and it appears that
the tables have been turned. You now
hold the joker, and I am in your power."</p>

<p>"There is no denying that."</p>

<p>"And what am I to expect?"</p>

<p>"You will have to dance to my tune,
now, seeing that the tables have turned,
as you say, and I am now the fiddler. I
gave you warning of that."</p>

<p>"And I remember that I reminded you
that should this thing occur, you would
be honor bound to deal as honorably with
me as I dealt with you, which you promised
you would do."</p>

<p>"And he will keep his promise, sir,"
spoke up the young woman.</p>

<p>She looked at Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Captain Joaquin
snarled. "At the same time, you must
admit that self-preservation is the first
law of nature. I must treat you as I
would a rattlesnake, which, if I let it
go, would turn and bite me."</p>

<p>"Is your former proposition still
open?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"To join you."</p>

<p>"No, that is closed."</p>

<p>Dick smiled.</p>

<p>"I was not wrong, then, in my estimate
of your earnestness when you made it,
even if I did give you the benefit of the
doubt," he said.</p>

<p>"That is a past question," said the
Red Rover. "You have since assured
me that nothing could tempt you to join
me, but on the other hand that you intend
to crush me."</p>

<p>"Let it pass," Dick waived.</p>

<p>Feeling by this time able to do so, he
got upon his feet, but he had to lean
against a boulder for support.</p>

<p>His head ached and was dizzy, and the
shot had given him an indescribable
numb feeling throughout his entire body.
It had been about as close a call as he
had ever experienced.</p>

<p>"You are now my prisoner," said the
outlaw. "Susana, you secure his weapons&mdash;there
they lie on the ground&mdash;and I
will handcuff him again. I will put on
that other pair, I think, seeing that you
had the choice of selection before," to
Dick.</p>

<p>"You have it all your own way, just
now," said Dick. "I am not in it, so to
say."</p>

<p>"You are right in it," the outlaw disputed.</p>

<p>"Well, no matter. If you are going to
handcuff me, though, I hope you will
dress the wound I have received."</p>

<p>The young woman opened her lips to
say something, but withheld her words
and looked to Captain Joaquin for the response.
Dick believed that he had a
friend in her.</p>

<p>His first thought had been that it was
she who had fired at him. He was now
in doubt on that point.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll tie it up," the outlaw
snapped.</p>

<p>Revolver in hand, he stepped forward
and felt in Dick's jacket pocket for the
remaining pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>They were there ready to his hand,
and he brought them forth and snapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
them upon Dick's wrists. Resistance
would have been useless, so Dick submitted.</p>

<p>"You have got me safe enough this
time," Dick observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess I have," was the response.
"And I intend to keep you so,
too."</p>

<p>"I do not blame you; I give you fair
warning that if I escape it will be to
open the warfare without quarter given
or asked."</p>

<p>"I am well aware of that."</p>

<p>"Dealing more than fairly with you
before, I am fair with you still, even
with the tide against me, so you may
know what to expect."</p>

<p>"You are a brave man, Deadwood Dick,
no gainsaying that. What you have just
said would be sufficient warrant for me
to put you to the death at once, for my
own protection."</p>

<p>"You have it in your power to do that,
but you are honor bound to give me a
chance for my life."</p>

<p>"Shall we carry out our duel?"</p>

<p>"I am not your match in condition,
after this wound."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be in a day or two.
Tie up his head for him, Susana, and
we'll go home."</p>

<p>The young woman tore a handkerchief
and made a temporary bandage, which
she wound around Dick's head, covering
the wound, and secured with pins.</p>

<p>"There, that will do until we get to
the cabin," she said. "When we get there
I will tie it up better and make it more
comfortable for you. While we are foes,
yet I can do that for you in mercy."</p>

<p>"You have not told me who shot me,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>The young woman flushed.</p>

<p>"Nor do we intend to," said Captain Joaquin.
"Be satisfied that you are alive,
and ask no questions."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that my first guess was
correct," said Dick. "What that guess
was, you no doubt rightly conjecture, so
we will say no more about it. I am, as
you said, glad I'm alive."</p>

<p>"Shall we go to the house?" asked
the young woman.</p>

<p>"I suppose we'll have to, with this
prisoner on our hands, though I ought to
return and look after that boodle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I had forgotten that."</p>

<p>"Still, it is safely cached, and is safer,
perhaps, than it would be at the cabin.
Come, we'll go to the cabin."</p>

<p>"No one saw you cache it?" asked
Susana.</p>

<p>"No one but this fellow."</p>

<p>"And you have got him secure enough.
Better leave it where it is."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin still had his revolver
in hand, and having slung his rifle across
his back he ordered Deadwood Dick to
precede him along the gulch bottom.</p>

<p>Half an hour's walk and several turnings
brought them at last into a glade
where a cabin stood under the shade of
some trees.</p>

<p>It was like an oasis in the rocky wilds.</p>

<p>A fertile little pocket in the midst of
wildest surroundings, it was an ideal
spot for such a retreat as Captain Joaquin
required when too hotly pressed by
the officers of the law.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick had at last the secret
of his rendezvous.</p>

<p>But at what a cost? He fully believed
that it was the intention of the Red
Rover that he should never leave the
place alive.</p>

<p>At the same time Dick was determined
that he would make his escape if given
half an opportunity, and that he would
eventually bring the infamous outlaw to
justice.</p>

<p>The young woman opened the door of
the cabin, and the outlaw ordered Dick
to enter, which he did. He had no choice
but to obey, for the present, though he
had yet another card in reserve for future
use as soon as the time was ripe for it.</p>

<p>Just what that card was will presently
be shown.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CHANCE FOR HIS LIFE.</p>


<p>The interior of the cabin was home-like.</p>

<p>It showed evidences of a woman's care,
and it was a most inviting retreat.</p>

<p>Having several apartments, it was
more than a cabin in the generally accepted
sense of the word, yet in outward
appearance it was a cabin nevertheless,
being of logs.</p>

<p>Well furnished, it displayed an abundance
of fancy articles that spoke mutely
of raids on the road and in towns to the
north and south. There were books,
pictures, and musical instruments, proof
that this notorious road-agent had refinement
of taste.</p>

<p>"Now, what are we going to do with
him?" demanded Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"I'll try to make myself as little
trouble to you as possible," said Dick.
"Put me anywhere that is convenient."</p>

<p>"How will this room do?" asked the
young woman, opening a door near at
hand.</p>

<p>"Anywhere," said Dick.</p>

<p>"I was not speaking to you, sir," she
snapped.</p>

<p>"Your pardon," said Dick, promptly.</p>

<p>"I suppose that will answer," growled
the Red Rover. "He cannot possibly
get out of there handcuffed, that is certain.
In with you."</p>

<p>"Pray put yourselves to as little
trouble as possible on my account,"
Dick politely requested as he stepped
into the room. "When you are at
leisure, Captain Joaquin, let me have an
interview."</p>

<p>"To what purpose?" was demanded.</p>

<p>"You will, in justice, give me a chance
for my life, of course."</p>

<p>"We will talk about that when I get
ready," was the snarl. "For the present
you remain here."</p>

<p>He closed the door with that, and
Dick heard him secure it on the other
side. The prince of detectives knew that
he could look for little mercy at the
hands of the Red Rover.</p>

<p>The room into which Dick had been
thrust was light. There was one window,
rather small and through which it
would be impossible for the prisoner to
climb with his hands secured as they
were. It gave him a view of the side
of the pocket opposite to the entrance.</p>

<p>There was a bed, a couple of chairs,
and a stand, in the way of furniture.</p>

<p>Dick threw himself on the bed, for his
head was beating and throbbing as if
ready to split, and his wound was very
painful, though slight.</p>

<p>He could hear Captain Joaquin and
the woman talking in the main room of
the cabin, but could not make out what
they were saying. He heard also other
voices from another direction.</p>

<p>These were the voices of two servants,
a negress and a Mexican half-breed
woman.</p>

<p>After a time the door opened and the
negress came in.</p>

<p>She was rather old.</p>

<p>"Whur'm dat dar so' head ob you's?"
she demanded in thick fashion. "I's
gwine to dress hit fo' yo'."</p>

<p>"I guess you will find it on my shoulders
yet, auntie," said Dick. "It was
there the last I knew anything about it,
anyhow. I hope you can ease the pain."</p>

<p>"Golly! I reckon I kin do dat dar,
child. Yo' roll ober heah and let old
Sal git a squint at it, and see ef I don't
make it feel better. Golly! you did git
a nasty one, shua 'nuff. One hair mo'
to de norf-east, and yo' was a goner,
shua!"</p>

<p>Dick had to smile at her quaint expressions.
He had been in a light
sleep, and felt better.</p>

<p>She had removed the bandage the
young woman had put on.</p>

<p>Having brought with her a basin of
water, she bathed the wound, and that
done, dressed it afresh with some kind
of pounded leaves.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what is going to
be done with me?" Dick inquired, while
she was at work.</p>

<p>"Not a bit ob one, sah," she answered.</p>

<p>"How many are there in the house?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Only de captain and de missus, and
us two old wimmin and yo'se'f."</p>

<p>"And when does the captain expect
the others to come in? His men come
here, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Some ob 'em does, but not many.
Some be heah to-night, I 'pine."</p>

<p>"And some others will never come,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"Dar, dar yo' am," the old negress
said with something of pride in her
tone. "Yo' jis' leab dat on dar an
hour, and yo' won't know yo'se'f, shua.
No pain kin stay whur dat am."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right, auntie. The
kindest old lady I ever knew looked
just like you. I hope you are right, and
that you won't forget that I am here
when the grub is passed around. I am
a trifle hungry, and a drink of cold
water would go particularly good just
now."</p>

<p>"Yo' shall hab it, child, yo' jis' bet!"</p>

<p>She gathered up her basin and things
and waddled out, for she was very fat,
and in a few minutes returned with a
pitcher of sparkling water.</p>

<p>A draught of that made Dick feel better
immediately, and he thanked the
woman in a way calculated to create a
friendly feeling toward himself. He
might need her service in some other
direction.</p>

<p>In a little while Captain Joaquin entered.</p>

<p>Dick was feeling much better, and was
sitting up when the outlaw made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Well, I have come to have that talk
with you," he announced.</p>

<p>"Glad of it," said Dick, "I am lonesome."</p>

<p>"I have thought of a plan, and I am
going to give you a chance for your life
about as good as you gave me."</p>

<p>"Ah! that so?"</p>

<p>"You will admit that the chance you
gave me was not a great big one, I suppose."</p>

<p>"It was just an even thing whether
you killed me or I killed you, Captain
Joaquin. I am willing to take the same
chance again."</p>

<p>"But I am not. You have the reputation
of being a dead-shot, Deadwood
Dick, and you certainly felt confident of
making cold meat of me when you offered
me that generous chance for my
life."</p>

<p>"I certainly meant to, unless you performed
that office for me," was the cool
admission.</p>

<p>"Well, I will give you just the same
kind of a show."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will fight?"</p>

<p>"I said I would not. No, but I will
give you an even chance for your life,
as promised."</p>

<p>"Well, I accept it. What is it?"</p>

<p>"No matter whether you accept it or
not, it is yours. Some of my men will
be here during the night, and when they
arrive I will carry out the plan."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to let me know
what it is?"</p>

<p>"If it will do you any good, I will
tell you."</p>

<p>"I am somewhat personally interested."</p>

<p>The outlaw laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess you are, too," he said.
"Well, it will be an even chance for
your life, I promise you that," he added.
"An equal number of white and of black
beans will be put into a bag, and you
will be required to draw one out. If it
be white, you live; black, and you die
at midnight."</p>

<p>Dick smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Suppose I should draw a white one,
does that give me my liberty?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at once. You will be taken away
from here blindfolded, and detained ten
days, at the end of which time you will
be set free. Meantime, I will have pulled
up stakes here and given you the slip."</p>

<p>"And you will give me no other chance
whatever?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll have to take what is
offered, of course, and be glad to get it,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"You may be thankful for it, for, if
you should draw the white, as you say,
it will mean a deuce of a lot of trouble
for me, and all because I feel bound to
give you this chance."</p>

<p>"You are in honor bound to do that,
no matter how small the chance may be,
after the way I risked my life against
yours, giving you the benefit of a doubt
where I did not believe that a doubt
existed at all. I'll expect you, then,
when your men arrive."</p>

<p>"As soon as they get here; I will not
keep you waiting."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">DICK IN A DEATH-TRAP.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick was again left alone.</p>

<p>A grim smile came over his face as he
looked at the door that had just closed.</p>

<p>"It is a bitter pill for him to swallow,
this giving me a chance for my life,"
he said to himself, "and I'll bet ten to
one that I don't get it on the square."</p>

<p>The chances were that he would not.</p>

<p>"I was a fool, perhaps, to take the
risk I did with the fellow, when the
law was all on my side, but I took him
so utterly by surprise that it did not
seem exactly fair. The trouble is, my
heart is entirely too big and too soft for
the profession I am following."</p>

<p>It was not that; the trouble was, he
was too honorable with the desperate
characters with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>But, that was Deadwood Dick's way.</p>

<p>The day waned and night came on at
last. Dick had been well fed, by the
old negress, and he felt grateful toward
her.</p>

<p>He had seen nothing more of the
young woman, but had heard her singing
at different times during the afternoon.
He had no reason to look for
any assistance from her.</p>

<p>In the evening she and Captain Joaquin
sang together in the main room,
and it was singing well worthy attention.</p>

<p>It caused Dick to sigh for a life so
misspent.</p>

<p>Finally, after some time, the door of
the room Dick was in opened, and a
flood of light streamed in.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin entered, and Susana
came as far as the doorway, where she
stood framed in the light, clad in a
gown that made her appear beautiful
in the soft radiance.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are still here, eh?"
said the outlaw.</p>

<p>He could not see at once, coming out
of the lighted room.</p>

<p>"You might be sure of that," said
Dick. "I would remain, even were I
free, to listen to your singing."</p>

<p>"I have not come in for flattery nor
praise, but to make sure that you are
secure. Let me feel of those handcuffs
before I retire for the night. My men
may not be here till morning."</p>

<p>"Here they are; feel to your satisfaction."</p>

<p>He did so.</p>

<p>"No getting out of them," he said.
"You are as safely my prisoner as I
was yours once to-day, if not more so,
Deadwood Dick."</p>

<p>"You need not remind me of it," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night. If the men come,
I will call you up, for some deeds are
more agreeable in the dark than in the
daylight."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I mean, if you should have the ill
luck to draw a black."</p>

<p>"I understand you, I guess, captain.
You will find me here when you want
me. I may be a little hard to awaken,
but shake me hard and you will bring
me out of it."</p>

<p>"You will be awakened, never fear."</p>

<p>The outlaw withdrew and closed and
secured the door, and after a time the
cabin was dark and silent.</p>

<p>A little longer, and Deadwood Dick
rose silently to his feet.</p>

<p>Lifting his wrists to his face, he was
occupied for some moments at something,
and presently there was a faint
click.</p>

<p>He removed the handcuffs from his
wrists and put them into his jacket
pocket, and took a key from his mouth,
where it had long been concealed, and
put it into the pocket of his vest.</p>

<p>Taking care to make no sound, he
moved to the window and carefully
worked the sash open to its widest extent.</p>

<p>That done, he put a chair under it and
prepared to take leave.</p>

<p>He listened.</p>

<p>No sound was to be heard within.</p>

<p>Putting his head out he listened again,
and all was silence the most profound.</p>

<p>Satisfied, he began to worm his body
through the small opening, and presently
had succeeded in getting his head and
shoulders through, with his face upward.</p>

<p>Pausing a moment, he continued
pressing through, and at last came as far
as his knees, holding fast to the lower
sash with his hands the while.</p>

<p>In that position he stopped a moment
to rest and listen.</p>

<p>Hearing nothing, he let go with his
hands and swung down, hanging by his
legs, and his hands came in contact with
the ground.</p>

<p>It was an easy thing, then, to let go
with his legs and turn over and land
upon his feet, and he did it with scarcely
any more noise than a cat would have
made.</p>

<p>He was without his weapons, but he
was free.</p>

<p>Knowing the direction he must take,
he set forward immediately, taking the
greatest care that his steps were too
light to be heard.</p>

<p>In a few moments he was out of
hearing distance from the cabin, so far
as his steps were concerned, and he
then struck out at a rapid pace in the
direction of the gulch.</p>

<p>He was going straight to the treasure
cache to secure the treasure, and would
then put all the distance possible between
himself and the outlaws before
daylight.</p>

<p>He could cache the money again, and
in due time return with a posse and
secure it.</p>

<p>"There will be something of a surprise
when they find that I am gone,
I imagine," he said to himself. "I would
like to be there to see Captain Joaquin's
face at the moment."</p>

<p>Not as a prisoner, however. He knew
he would have no chance whatever for
his life, or so, at any rate, he believed.</p>

<p>The night was dark, but there was
enough light to see general outlines.</p>

<p>He pushed on, keeping to the trail as
he remembered it, and he had taken
good care to fix it well in his mind.</p>

<p>At length he came to the place where
the duel was to have been fought but
where he had been cut down by the
bullet that had plowed the gash in his
scalp.</p>

<p>Still on, and at last he came to the
rough way that led to the top of the
little peak on which the treasure had
been cached, and here he had the hardest
climb of all.</p>

<p>In daylight, it was not easy, but by
night, and unfamiliar as he was with
the ground, it was doubly difficult.</p>

<p>But it was at last accomplished, after
an hour's work.</p>

<p>He stood on the plateau.</p>

<p>Sitting down on the edge of the table
to rest, before proceeding further, a
sound presently reached his ears.</p>

<p>It caused him a start, and he was on
his feet instantly.</p>

<p>Again he heard it, and knew that he
was not mistaken this time; it was
voices.</p>

<p>With all haste he turned to the boulder
and applied his shoulder to it at the
point where Captain Joaquin had put
his strength to it some hours before.</p>

<p>At first it did not move, but remembering
how the Red Rover had put forth
all his strength by surging against it,
Dick now did the same, and presently
the boulder moved and finally turned
over.</p>

<p>Lighting a match, Dick looked into the
cavity, and there was the bag of money
exactly as it had been deposited.</p>

<p>He had it out in a second, and did not
stop to replace the stone.</p>

<p>If he could get away from the top of
the peak before discovered, he would
have a chance.</p>

<p>It would take Captain Joaquin some
time to climb up to look for the treasure,
and while he was doing that Dick
could be putting distance between himself
and them.</p>

<p>What was the best of all, he would
leave no trail that they could follow,
having nothing but bare rock for his
footing.</p>

<p>He readily imagined what had taken
place at the cabin.</p>

<p>The men had come, and Captain Joaquin
had entered the room to bring him
forth and discovered him gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thought, naturally, would be
for the money in the cache, and the
Red Rover would lead the way thither
with all speed&mdash;the very thing he was
doing.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were even then nearer
than Dick imagined, and just as he
swung his legs over the edge of the
plateau to begin the descent, the light
of torches flashed out of the gulch below
and his pursuers discovered him.
With a wild shout, they opened fire upon
him immediately.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick was in a death-trap.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DICK'S ONLY DEFENSE.</p>


<p>"Surrender!" called out Captain Joaquin.</p>

<p>"We'll consider that point a bit first,"
responded Dick.</p>

<p>He had drawn back out of range with
considerable alacrity, for the bullets had
come uncomfortably close.</p>

<p>"You will surrender, and that unconditionally,
or we will riddle you with
bullets!" was the threat. "You have
now cancelled any obligation I may have
been under."</p>

<p>"If I surrender at all, it will be under
conditions," rejoined Dick. "We will
make terms, or I will fight it out to the
death."</p>

<p>"It will be to your death, then, not
mine."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that."</p>

<p>"You are not armed."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No, you are not."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to show you? You
present a fine target there where you
stand."</p>

<p>There were five men in the company,
four besides the captain, and those four
sprang to cover instantly, lest a shot
might find them.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, boys," he said.
"I tell you he is not armed. I took his
guns away from him, and he has had
no chance to get others. We must have
him down from there!"</p>

<p>"There is only one way to get me,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"And we will take that way."</p>

<p>"At your peril."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin was no coward. He
started forward at once, calling on his
men to follow.</p>

<p>The men responded, reassured by the
word of their leader, as well as by his
own intrepid example, and followed the
Red Rover up the steep ascent with their
torches.</p>

<p>"Hold!"</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick so ordered.</p>

<p>They stopped and looked up, as men
in their position naturally would do.</p>

<p>"You will advance another step at
your peril," Dick warned them. "I am
safe from your bullets, but you are in
plain open sight there, and it seems a
pity to pick you off."</p>

<p>"That be hanged!" cried Captain
Joaquin. "You are talking to gain time,
that is all. Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>"Do you want this boulder rolled
down upon you?" cried Dick.</p>

<p>It was useless for him to pretend that
he was armed, when he was not armed.
A shot would have been the only proof
of that.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the captain.
"Four men like you could not roll that
boulder out of the cavity in which it
lies. I tell you we have got you, and
you can't escape us."</p>

<p>There was not a doubt of it.</p>

<p>It was all true, what was said of the
boulder. It weighed a ton if it weighed
a pound.</p>

<p>The reason that one man was enabled
to move it at all was because it was
partly balanced in the little basin in
which it rested, and could be tilted to
another bearing in one direction.</p>

<p>"Hold!"</p>

<p>Dick's voice rang out again, more
forceful than at first.</p>

<p>Again his foes stopped, for they were
in no position to disregard such a command
from a desperate man.</p>

<p>"Well, what now?" demanded the
Red Rover.</p>

<p>"I told you that we would make
terms, or I would fight it to the death."</p>

<p>"Bah! what care I for your threats?
What position are you in to talk of
terms? You are as good as in my hands
already. Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>"One moment," cried Dick. "It is
true that I have no guns at hand, as you
well know, and it is also true that I
cannot roll the boulder, but I have a
weapon nevertheless."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"This bag of money."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! What is that?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you what it is. It is a
fortune in compact form. If I set a
match to its contents it will go up in
smoke."</p>

<p>There was a howl instantly.</p>

<p>"And I can do it before you can get
up to a level where you can get a shot
at me," said Dick. "All you will find
will be a little heap of ashes for your
trouble."</p>

<p>"You do not dare!" howled the Red
Rover. "You would not have the nerve
to destroy such a fortune!"</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No! I defy you!"</p>

<p>"All right, come on and see. It will
take you several minutes to get here,
and by that time I can have destroyed
it."</p>

<p>"But, what of you? By heavens, I
would put pitch on you and burn you
at the stake, Deadwood Dick! You do
not know the tiger of my nature yet,
or you would not rouse it."</p>

<p>"I am seeking rather to tame it," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"And I swear that I will do just as I
say, if you destroy that money before I
can get hold of it."</p>

<p>"I would prefer a leap off this peak
to the depths below, rather than that,"
said Dick, "and I could carry with me
what of the money I might not have time
to burn."</p>

<p>"You would not do that."</p>

<p>"There is one way for you to prove
it, come and see."</p>

<p>"You have no matches there."</p>

<p>"Here is proof of that."</p>

<p>Dick struck a match as he spoke, and
set fire to a piece of paper he happened
to have in his pocket.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin was dismayed.</p>

<p>Dick could hear him consulting in low
tones with his men.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?"
Dick inquired, after a pause. "I am
ready to offer my terms."</p>

<p>He had a potent weapon to use against
them, and that was the possession of the
fortune they had risked so much to get
possession of that day.</p>

<p>"Ready to offer terms," sneered the
Red Rover. "You mean that you are
ready to accept such terms as you can
get, I guess. We will be the ones to
offer, if any terms are made at all. We
hold the winning hand."</p>

<p>"And I hold the stuff. Don't make
any mistake."</p>

<p>"Well, what would you call terms?"</p>

<p>"If I surrender to you, with this bag
of money intact, will you allow me to
go free?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll do that," was the prompt
answer. And every one of them voiced
approval. They were prompt and liberal
with their promises, if he would surrender
at once.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick laughed at them.</p>

<p>"It is too plain a case," he said.
"That is not the kind of a bargain I am
going to make with you, however."</p>

<p>"You won't trust us?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"You will have to, or we will starve
you out. And at the first sight we get
of you we'll pick you off."</p>

<p>"Try that, my friends, and every
hour I remain here I will burn ten
thousand dollars of this money. I have
got money to burn, not only figuratively,
but actually."</p>

<p>"Curse you! What terms do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Ha! I thought you would presently
recognize that I hold the better hand,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"I recognize nothing of the kind,"
was the return, "but I don't want you
to be fool enough to destroy that money&mdash;my
hard earnings."</p>

<p>"That is precisely the little joker I
hold," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to return my revolvers to
me, in good order&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, do you take us for fools altogether?
We have got the advantage,
now, and, we mean to keep it. Forward,
men, and at him!"</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Dick yet once again.
"You evidently forget the fate of this
money if you advance another step. And
more than that, if you keep me here one
hour the pile will be ten thousand dollars
less."</p>

<p>It was a peculiar situation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CAUGHT IN THE TOILS.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick was in a desperate fix.</p>

<p>He did not see any way of escape, no
matter which way he looked.</p>

<p>Having been there in the daylight, he
knew there was no way down save in
the one direction.</p>

<p>And in that direction the way was
blocked by the outlaws, who would shoot
him on sight as they would shoot a dog
that might offend them.</p>

<p>They had the advantage of him in every
way save one only. He held them in
momentary check by his threat to destroy
the prize they were after, and
which, according to their code, belonged
to them.</p>

<p>There was another consultation among
them.</p>

<p>Then Captain Joaquin called out:</p>

<p>"Deadwood Dick?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We have to admit that you have got
the best of it at present. We are willing
to make terms with you."</p>

<p>"Well, you have heard one of the conditions."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that would be to place still
more advantage on your side. We can't
afford to arm you against ourselves, you
know."</p>

<p>"That is one of the conditions, nevertheless,
and I want to tell you that you
are letting valuable time get away from
you. I mean business when I say I will
burn this stuff."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't do that; we'll come to an agreement
somehow."</p>

<p>"What do you propose, then?"</p>

<p>"You come down here with that cash,
and we'll give you the chance I told you
about."</p>

<p>"The drawing for a white bean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What assurance have I that I will not
be shot at sight?"</p>

<p>"None but our word. We'll respect
that, if you are willing to meet us half
way. We are determined to have that
money."</p>

<p>"Joaquin?"</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice that called.</p>

<p>Dick recognized it as the voice of Susana,
and wondered what had brought
her there.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" cried
Captain Joaquin, in something of anger.
"I thought I told you to remain at the
house."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I could not do that, with you
in danger. I had to come out and find
you. Do not be angry with me; I could
not help it. Besides, I was anxious about
your treasure."</p>

<p>She had come out into sight, while
speaking.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick was peering over the
edge of the ledge, at a point where a
shadow protected him.</p>

<p>He saw the young woman cast a swift
glance around, saw that she was nearly
out of breath from evident haste, and
that her face was flushed.</p>

<p>"What danger am I in?" was the angry
demand.</p>

<p>"No danger, I hope, but I could not
know that. I could not remain there in
uncertainty. Do not be angry, Joaquin."</p>

<p>"Well, sit down and rest yourself, and
do not interfere in this matter. Now,
Deadwood Dick, let me know at once
what you will do or what you want us
to do."</p>

<p>"If you will return my revolvers to
me, in good order and loaded, I will
come down and turn this money over
to you, on condition that you let me
escape with my life, or give me a fair
chance to do so. It is for you to accept
or refuse, as you please."</p>

<p>"We refuse."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; this money goes up
in smoke."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" cried the young woman.
"Do not burn the money, sir, I beg of
you!"</p>

<p>"It is the only weapon I have," declared
Dick. "Without it, I could not
hold your cutthroats at bay for a moment.
With it I must bargain for my
life."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you regret the chance you
gave me," suggested Joaquin.</p>

<p>"No, I do not. I was simply giving
you the benefit of a possible doubt,
though, in truth, I did not believe it existed."</p>

<p>"And what do you promise him now,
Joaquin?" the young woman inquired.</p>

<p>"I have promised him his life if he
will come down here with that money,"
the Red Rover explained.</p>

<p>"You had better accept it, sir," the
young woman called out. "You are at a
disadvantage, and cannot possibly hold
out there a great while. That is your only
chance."</p>

<p>"But I have only the word of an outlaw
that my life will be spared."</p>

<p>"That word will be kept, will it not,
Joaquin?"</p>

<p>"Of course it will be kept. But I told
you not to meddle in this matter. Keep
out of it, now, or return to the house at
once!"</p>

<p>The young woman gave him a sharp
glance, and leaned back against a boulder
that lay behind the stone on which she
had sat down. Dick believed that he
caught a look of pain on her face as the
torches lighted it up.</p>

<p>"It is all one-sided," said Deadwood
Dick. "Arm me, and make me an equal,
and I will leave the bag of money here
and come down and go away. Refuse,
and I will carry out the threats I have
made. There need be no further parley
about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll do it, but I have not got
your weapons here."</p>

<p>"Send for them."</p>

<p>"It will take time to get them."</p>

<p>"No matter, we can call a stay of proceedings
until your man returns with
them."</p>

<p>"And you will destroy none of the
money mean time?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not."</p>

<p>"Agreed."</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin spoke a few words to
one of his men, and the fellow started off.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick withdrew from the
edge of the ledge then, and put on his
thinking cap. The advantage lay with
the outlaws, there was no denying it.
He did not believe they would be fools
enough to arm him.</p>

<p>There must be some trick in it, he believed,
but what it could be he could not
imagine. He looked around for a means
of escape, but knowing full well that it
did not exist. He would have to trust to
the word of the outlaw captain, and take
chances.</p>

<p>No word was passed between Captain
Joaquin and him during the time the man
was gone, and Dick waited eagerly for
the fellow's return. He had a scheme in
mind, but whether it could be made to
work or not remained to be seen. It
would be at the risk of his life, but he
hoped to give them the slip and get
away with the booty.</p>

<p>At last he came.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin called out to Dick, and
he responded.</p>

<p>"Here are your weapons, now, but how
are they to be sent up to you? And
what assurance have we that you will
keep your word?"</p>

<p>"I have a plan to propose," said Dick.
"Let that lady bring them up to me, and
she may carry the bag down to you in
exchange. Then, when you find that it is
all right, all go away and leave me to
come down when I please."</p>

<p>That, however, was not his scheme.</p>

<p>"What is the sense of that?" demanded
the Red Rover. "I will bring them up
myself."</p>

<p>"And perhaps shoot me the moment
you come where you can get a bead on
me. I will not trust you that far, Captain
Joaquin, for I do not believe you
mean to allow me to get away from here
if you can help it."</p>

<p>"But you have my word that you shall
be allowed to go away alive&mdash;that is,
that your life will be spared."</p>

<p>"And he will keep his word, sir,"
spoke up the woman.</p>

<p>"You have nothing but his promise,
the same as I," said Dick. "He must
meet my terms, or I will carry out the
threat I have made. It can only cost my
life, anyhow and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A noise just behind him caught Dick's
ear at that instant, and he turned his
head to see what it was, when a man
threw himself upon him and bore him to
the ground. Dick, already kneeling, was
taken at a disadvantage, and he was
shoved headlong over the ledge.</p>

<p>Even as he felt himself going, the
thought came to him to protect his head
with the bag of money, and so he did,
holding it tight to his head and drawing
himself into as much of a ball as possible,
for there was not the least use in his
trying to save himself the fall down the
rugged side of the cliff. And so he fell,
over and over, landing at the feet of
Captain Joaquin.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DEADWOOD DICK BRANDED.</p>


<p>A shout of exultation had accompanied
Dick's hasty departure from the cliff, and
a burst of laughter greeted him from below.</p>

<p>The instant he landed, for the moment
more dead than alive, ready hands seized
him and a pistol was clapped to his head,
and Captain Joaquin snatched away the
bag of money.</p>

<p>This the Red Rover opened immediately,
to make sure that its contents were
intact.</p>

<p>"What is to be done with him?" one
of his men demanded.</p>

<p>"You know who he is," was the response.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is Deadwood Dick."</p>

<p>"And what is he to us? What is he
to all of our class?"</p>

<p>"That's so. Death to him, boys; death
to Deadwood Dick! Where is the rope?"</p>

<p>"Hold on," spoke up the young woman,
who had leaped to her feet at the
shout from the cliff. "You promised him
his life, Joaquin."</p>

<p>"If he came to my terms, yes, but he
did not do that. He is our foe, Susana,
and he must die. The world is not wide
enough to hold us and him, after this
night's work."</p>

<p>"That's so," shouted the men. "Death
to Deadwood Dick!"</p>

<p>"Hang him," said the captain.</p>

<p>Dick was jerked upon his feet roughly,
and his hands were speedily tied behind
his back.</p>

<p>Mean time the young woman had
thrown herself upon her knees before
Captain Joaquin, pleading for his life,
reminding him of the chance Dick had
given him for his.</p>

<p>"Get up, fool!" the Red Rover sternly
ordered. "Have you taken leave of your
senses? Let him escape, and we are done
for. No, he dies, here and now, and no
more fooling about it. Get up, I say,
and do not anger me against yourself,
Susana!"</p>

<p>"But your promise," she reminded, rising.</p>

<p>"That for it," with a snap of the fingers.</p>

<p>"But I had always looked upon your
spoken word as sacred, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, what is this man to you,
Susana?" was the rough demand, laying
a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of him, but of you,
Joaquin. I do not want to think of you as
a murderer&mdash;a murderer! I am afraid&mdash;I
believe&mdash;I know it would set me against
you."</p>

<p>"Bah! you are a woman. Get out of the
way, now, for business is business. He
has got to die&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Joaquin, for my sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"For my love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By heavens! I begin to think there
is more to it than you would express.
Men, an example shall be made of this
fellow. I'll brand him before we hang
him!"</p>

<p>The young woman uttered a scream.</p>

<p>"Ha! I thought so," the Red Rover
sneered. "A woman's heart is as fickle
as the weather. This fellow's make-believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
chivalry has stolen your affection
from me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no! no! Great heavens! how you
wrong me!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Then what is the matter
with killing him, since he is my mortal
foe, and it must be his life or mine sooner
or later?"</p>

<p>"But, your honor, Joaquin, your honor,"
she reminded him. "He gave you
your life, or a chance for it, and you
pledged your word that you would do
the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! Choose between us, Susana."</p>

<p>"I choose you, of course," attempting
to throw her arms around his neck, an
action which he repelled. "He is nothing
to me; I only want to see your honor
preserved."</p>

<p>"Bah! You think to blind me. What
can we brand him with, boys? He shall
go to the devil with a mark of Captain
Joaquin's compliments!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah! That is what he deserves!"</p>

<p>"Here is a horseshoe; will that do?"</p>

<p>"The very thing!"</p>

<p>"It will give him a mark for good
luck!"</p>

<p>"Joaquin! In heaven's name show
mercy! If you do this thing, you kill my
love for you at a single stroke."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>He pushed her roughly away from him.</p>

<p>"At least do not torture him," she
cried. "At least spare him that, I beg,
I implore."</p>

<p>"And all because he has stolen your
affection from me," he cried, with jealous
intensity. "Yes, I will spare him;
another word from you, and I will burn
out his eyes!"</p>

<p>With a scream, the young woman covered
her face with her hands and staggered
away from the scene.</p>

<p>"Where is that horseshoe?" the enraged
captain demanded. "Put these
torches together, and lay it on them till
it is heated. I will make an example
of Deadwood Dick that will be a warning
to all other detectives to steer clear of
Captain Joaquin!"</p>

<p>The horseshoe was handed forward,
and the torches were placed together as
ordered, and the iron laid upon them.
Then, while two of the cutthroats fanned
the blaze with their hats, two more
threw Dick to the ground and tore open
his shirt in front, baring his breast.</p>

<p>Wonderful to say, Dick had received no
broken bones by his fall down the ragged
side of the cliff.</p>

<p>He had spoken no word, seeing the
uselessness of it.</p>

<p>The young woman stood at some distance
away, wringing her hands, but
afraid to say any further word for fear
that Captain Joaquin would carry out
his more terrible threat.</p>

<p>All were silent, and the fire was fanned
until at last the shoe began to take on
the color of the flame.</p>

<p>"How hot do you want et, captain?"
one of the scoundrels asked.</p>

<p>"That will do," was the answer. "How
will you handle it, though? A stick will
do, however."</p>

<p>"Yes, or a rifle barrel. Say when you
are ready, and we'll give him sech a
brand as will identify him hereafter
when we meet him down below. Ha! ha!
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Get ready."</p>

<p>"All ready, cap'n."</p>

<p>"One moment, then. Susana?"</p>

<p>He called out to the young woman.</p>

<p>"I hear you, Joaquin."</p>

<p>"Come here and see how I treat a
rival when I catch him."</p>

<p>"No, no! Spare me that, Joaquin, spare
me that! He is no rival; it was only of
you I thought!"</p>

<p>"Bah! you lie to me. I'll fetch you&mdash;ha!
ha!"</p>

<p>He made a dash at her, but with another
scream she turned and fled from
sight.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin returned laughing,
and ordered the hot iron to be laid upon
Deadwood Dick's bare breast, and a man
brought it from the fire on the end of a
rifle barrel.</p>

<p>"Anything to say, Deadwood Dick?"
the Red Rover inquired.</p>

<p>"Only this," said Dick: "If you do this
thing, you will be the object of my vengeance
even in another world&mdash;I swear
it."</p>

<p>"Bosh! Put on the brand, my man."</p>

<p>The barrel of the rifle was lowered, and
the hot horseshoe slipped off and fell
upon Deadwood Dick's bare skin.</p>

<p>The victim gave a convulsive movement
as the hot iron touched his skin,
and struggled furiously, an involuntary
cry of anguish escaping his lips, but he
was firmly held.</p>

<p>A second&mdash;perhaps two, and the report
of a rifle rang out, and Captain Joaquin
uttered a sharp cry and staggered.
But only for a moment; he recovered
himself, and, with hand pressed to his
side, ran in the direction whence the
shot had come, shouting back:</p>

<p>"That wildcat did it! But I will have
her; you hang that fellow and come at
once to the cabin." And he disappeared,
while those who had been holding Deadwood
Dick to the ground jerked him upon
his feet, and the iron dropped off and fell
to the ground, leaving its imprint upon
the fair flesh of the intrepid prince of
detectives!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SUSANA TO THE RESCUE.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick believed that the end
of his eventful career had come at last.</p>

<p>There was not a ray of hope for him,
and he was faint and sick from the intense
pain of the hot iron that had been
laid upon his breast.</p>

<p>With his hands tied, and his head
swimming, he was powerless to resist his
foes, and the rope was quickly placed
around his neck and he was dragged in
the direction of a tree near at hand.</p>

<p>He was not even asked if he had a last
word to say. The end of the rope was
thrown over the limb, the cutthroats
caught hold of it and pulled, and Deadwood
Dick, the fearless, the generous,
was swung clear of the ground and the
end of the rope was secured to the body
of the tree.</p>

<p>"Is he to be shot as well?" demanded
one of the villains.</p>

<p>"No, he ain't worth wastin' good powder
and lead on," was the response from
another.</p>

<p>"That's so," said a third. "Let him
swing and think about et while his speerit
is workin' itself loose in ther shell."</p>

<p>"Come on; ther captain said come to
ther cabin at oncet."</p>

<p>"Hooray! Good-by, Deadwood Dick!"</p>

<p>With whoop and yell they hastened
from the scene of their dastardly outrage,
and followed in the direction Captain
Joaquin had taken.</p>

<p>Barely had they gone when a panting
form sprang out of a crevice in the rocks.</p>

<p>It was Susana.</p>

<p>With a suppressed cry she ran to the
tree with all speed, and with a single
sweep of a keen knife severed the rope.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick dropped to the ground
heavily, all limp and apparently lifeless,
and the young woman was at his side instantly,
her eager fingers at work at
the noose.</p>

<p>It was quickly loosened and removed.</p>

<p>"He must not die, he shall not die!"
she cried to herself. "I will save him for
his revenge. You accused me of loving
him, Captain Joaquin, wrongly accused
me, but I will love him now, love him
with my whole heart, for you have made
me hate you&mdash;hate you!"</p>

<p>She lifted Dick's head and pressed
warm and passionate kisses upon his
face, believing he was wholly unconscious.</p>

<p>To her surprise her last kiss was returned.</p>

<p>She sprang up with a startled little
cry, and released her hold instantly.</p>

<p>"I owe my life to you," said Dick, in
low tone. "I shall not soon forget the
obligation, I promise you."</p>

<p>"I regret that I could not save you the
torture you had to undergo," was the response.
"You heard his threats; I was
afraid to say another word in your favor."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you did not do so. But
release me quickly and let me get hold
of my weapons&mdash;which they left yonder
on the ground. They may return, and
not only my life, but yours, is now at
stake. There will be another reckoning
before the account is closed."</p>

<p>She freed his hands even while he was
speaking.</p>

<p>"Yes, there will be another reckoning,"
she said, in low, intense tones,
"and in it I will be on your side. I hate
him&mdash;hate him now as much as I ardently
loved him before&mdash;or thought I loved
him. How blind I was to his true character!"</p>

<p>"Do you know what is good for a
burn?" Dick asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; why did I not think of it?
How you must suffer! Wait, I will dress
that wound in a moment."</p>

<p>Snatching a brand from the fire in
which the horseshoe had been heated,
she sought eagerly around and plucked
here and there a kind of weed that grew
in the rock crevices.</p>

<p>While she was thus engaged, Dick secured
his revolvers and also the horseshoe
with which he had been branded.</p>

<p>The latter was still hot, of course.</p>

<p>Having gathered some of the weeds,
the girl laid them on a stone and pounded
them to a pulp, and, tearing a strip
from an article of her linen, she spread
the poultice upon it.</p>

<p>"Now, let me fix it," she said to Dick.</p>

<p>Dick sat down and bared his breast,
and she applied the cooling pulp to the
wound, the contact causing Dick to give
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"That feels good," he said.</p>

<p>"It will soon draw out the fire," said
the girl, "and it will aid the wound to
heal quickly, too."</p>

<p>Securing the poultice in place as well
as possible, she fastened Dick's shirt
over it, and when she had done Dick took
her in his arms and embraced her, returning
the kisses she had given him.</p>

<p>"You have given me your life," he
said; "what can I do for you in return?"</p>

<p>"Give me your protection," was the response.</p>

<p>"You shall have that, to the death."</p>

<p>"And let me aid you in your revenge
against that monster. Ugh! how I hate
him now!"</p>

<p>"But, he is your husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, he was not my husband; I am
free, as free as a bird. I loved him, and
would have wed him, but I am thankful
my eyes were opened before I was linked
to him for life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you desire to escape him now?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! he would murder me now,
after what I have done. Yes, yes, I desire
to escape; I want you to protect me."</p>

<p>"Enough said," agreed Dick, giving
her another embrace and releasing her.
"I'll try and do something in return for
the risk you have taken for me, and together
we will hunt him down."</p>

<p>"At once?"</p>

<p>"No, we will let him feel secure for a
time, and the blow will be all the greater
when it falls. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Are you to be depended on?"</p>

<p>"To be depended on? I do not understand
you, sir."</p>

<p>"Call me Dick. I mean, will you hold
out to the end, when it comes to the
test?"</p>

<p>"Will I hold out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps your love will rekindle, and
you will balk my revenge when it comes
to the hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, a thousand times no! My hate
is even more intense than was my love.
No, no, I will not falter; I am now yours,
if you will let me be yours, and our purpose
is one."</p>

<p>"It is a bargain," said Dick. "Here
is my hand, little pard."</p>

<p>The girl placed her hand in his.</p>

<p>"Hands up! both of ye!"</p>

<p>The voice was so near that both were
startled, and Dick felt a gun behind his
ear.</p>

<p>It was so sudden that Dick obeyed before
the thought came to him to resist,
but perhaps it was as well, for that might
have meant his instant death.</p>

<p>"It is Booth!" cried the girl in dismay.
"We are lost&mdash;lost!"</p>

<p>"Bet yer life ye are," said the man.
"Ye forgot to reckon me, I guess. Et
took me a good while to worm up
into that peak by the crevice inside and
take this galoot by surprise, and et has
took me a good while to git down
again, but hyer I am and hyer you be,
too."</p>

<p>"And what do you expect to do with
us?" asked Dick, grimly.</p>

<p>"Take ye straight to Captain Joaquin,
of course."</p>

<p>"Never!" said the young woman.</p>

<p>"I'll show ye. You turn&mdash; Ugghh!"</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick's foot had suddenly
caught the fellow in the middle, and
over he went with a grunt terrific.</p>

<p>No sooner had he fallen than the girl
was upon him, and her knife was buried
in his breast, straight and true, and the
cutthroat stiffened out to rise no more.</p>

<p>"There is one less," she said, rising.
"I never killed a human before, but I
would kill a score rather than be taken
back to that man. Thank heaven, we are
free yet, Dick. Do you want further
proof of my devotion to you? Can you
ask it?"</p>

<p>"I did not ask anything more than
your word, Susana. You are a pard worth
having. We will hang this fellow to the
tree where they hanged me, and should
they come this way again they will believe
that Deadwood Dick is still there
where they left him, and the surprise
will be all the greater when the blow
falls, as fall it must."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BANKER BROWN OF POWDER POCKET.</p>


<p>Meantime, Captain Joaquin had gone
straight to the cabin.</p>

<p>He believed that Susana would go
there to gather up some effects before
trying to run away.</p>

<p>Of course he knew, or believed, that
the shot had been fired at him by her,
and that only confirmed the suspicion
he had formed against her.</p>

<p>Had he caught her, a horrible fate
would have been hers. Smarting under
the wound she had given him&mdash;for the
bullet had lodged in his shoulder&mdash;he
was in the right mood to wreak vengeance.</p>

<p>But he failed to find her.</p>

<p>There was no sign of her at the cabin,
no indication that she had been there&mdash;in
fact, the servants declared that she
had not been there.</p>

<p>Back he started, and had gone but a
little way when he met his men coming,
and he scattered them all to look for
the missing young woman, with orders
to take her dead or alive.</p>

<p>They went out by the various trails&mdash;rather
possible avenues, for there were
no trails proper there, but they failed to
find her. And when Captain Joaquin and
two of the men came out at the place
where Dick had been hanged, they found
his body swaying to and fro in the breeze.</p>

<p>Nor was she found. And when, later
on in the night, others of the band came
in in haste with certain intelligence concerning
the sheriff and his posse, Captain
Joaquin deserted his cabin and took
to the hills, and was not seen in that section
again. On the following day the
cabin was discovered and looted and
burned, but the birds had flown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Deadwood Dick, with Susana,
was making his way to the south,
keeping to the hills in order not to be
discovered.</p>

<p>Dick wanted it to appear that he was
dead.</p>

<p>He learned enough from Susana to give
him a suspicion as to what Captain Joaquin
would do, and he felt that he could
afford to give him time.</p>

<p>They crossed the border into Mexico,
where Dick quietly rested for a season to
recover his full measure of health and
strength, and where Susana was his devoted
slave and companion.</p>

<p>Inquiry was being made in every direction
for Deadwood Dick.</p>

<p>It was known that the last case he had
undertaken was the hunting down of
Captain Joaquin, or the Red Rover, and
it was feared that he had met his death
at the hands of that cutthroat and this
band.</p>

<p>Dick remained in hiding, and thus Captain
Joaquin, wherever he might be,
would be lulled into the confirmation of
his belief that Deadwood Dick was no
longer to be feared. In fact, that worthy
was chuckling to himself, whenever a
newspaper item concerning Dick met his
eye. He believed that he alone, and those
of his men who had been in the secret,
could solve the mystery.</p>

<p>And so time passed on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Powder Pocket was a roaring camp.</p>

<p>It was at the top notch of the biggest
kind of a boom.</p>

<p>It had been a paying camp from the
first, with rich mines on every hand.</p>

<p>New finds, too, were being reported almost
daily, and people and money were
flowing in as freely as water flowed down
from the snow-capped peaks.</p>

<p>The newest institution of which Powder
Pocket could boast was a bank. It
was a private concern, had been opened
on a grand scale, and was being conducted
on a paying basis. Money could
be had in almost any amount, on big interest
and bigger security.</p>

<p>The head of this institution was one
Sigmund Brown.</p>

<p>He had come to Powder Pocket about
six months prior to the time of this introduction
of the camp.</p>

<p>Settling down quietly, he had rented
one of the best buildings in the place, refitted
it in fine style, and one morning
his sign was found adorning the front&mdash;S.
Brown, Banker.</p>

<p>He had a game in contemplation.</p>

<p>He had money, the other fellows had
the property. They could not do anything
without money.</p>

<p>His money was on call, as said, but
every loan was vouched for by an iron-clad
mortgage, and it was his boast that
in five years he would own the town.</p>

<p>The interest was high, the loan was
not sufficient, in most cases, to develop
beyond the mere beginnings, and on the
day when the interest could not be met
nor the principal paid, he would foreclose.</p>

<p>He was there to double&mdash;to treble his
pile, and he made no secret among his
intimates of his means.</p>

<p>One day a miner entered his private
office in an excited state.</p>

<p>The private office was always open to
those who came on particular business,
and this man had announced that his
business was of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>The clerks in the main room had seen
his kind before, often, and he was readily
admitted. He was, undoubtedly, a man
who had struck it rich and was eager
to mortgage and begin working the
claim.</p>

<p>He was a bearded fellow, roughly clad,
and was begrimed from hat to boots with
mud and clay.</p>

<p>"You aire Mr. Brown?" he eagerly
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am Mr. Brown. What can
I do for you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I have struck it rich&mdash;so all-fired
rich that it has 'most turned my head.
I want you to look at my find, which I
have registered all correct, and lend me a
loan on it so I kin open et up."</p>

<p>"That so? I congratulate you. Where
does it lie?"</p>

<p>"Hardly out of gunshot from the
camp, and it is the prince of 'em all, I'm
bettin'."</p>

<p>"It will be a pleasure to me to look at
it, the first opportunity, and if it is what
you think, there will be no trouble about
your getting a loan, I guess."</p>

<p>"No trouble at all, I'm bettin'. You
will open yer eyes when ye see et."</p>

<p>"What do you consider it worth?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five thousand, if a cent."</p>

<p>"And how much of a loan would you
want?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five thousand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whew!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"That is steep. I have never gone over
ten thousand into the best of them."</p>

<p>"But I tell ye this is the best of the
bunch. You will say so when ye see it,
and you won't hesitate a minnit to fork
et over, either."</p>

<p>"I must see it first of all. In a day or
two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't wait. I am in a fever. You
must come with me to-day&mdash;right now!"</p>

<p>"Impossible; I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will pay ye, boss. Why, it opens
up bigger'n that Castleville Bank shelled
out a year ago, and I ain't hardly cracked
the ground yet."</p>

<p>The banker had become suddenly pale.</p>

<p>He was a man with long hair, and wore
a mustache and goatee, and was altogether
a good-looking man.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked,
huskily, striving hard to remain composed.
"Where is Castleville? What do
you suppose I know about any bank business
at Castleville?"</p>

<p>"Castleville? Why, they closed the
bank, you know, and set out to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the funds to 'Frisco, but Captain Joaquin
got wind of it and held up the train and
scooped the pile. Not only that, but it
is believed that he murdered a detective
about the same time."</p>

<p>"A detective?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a chap they called Deadwood
Dick."</p>

<p>The man's face had grown paler, and
he was eyeing the caller sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, all that is nothing to me," he
declared. "I will go with you to-morrow
morning, start at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"And then I'll show you the richest
thing you ever saw in your life, if Captain
Joaquin don't gobble it mean time
and get away with et&mdash; Why, what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>The banker's face was deathly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered. "I am not
exactly well to-day. Come in the morning,
and I will be prepared to go with
you. Then, when I have had the property
passed upon by experts, your loan will
be advanced. You must excuse me, but I
am very busy to-day&mdash; Great heavens!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE FIRST BLOW STRUCK.</p>


<p>The caller had suddenly torn the beard
from his face and flung it to the floor.</p>

<p>It was the face of Deadwood Dick,
handsome, grim, and he looked the quailing
banker in the eyes as he stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know me, Joaquin Escala?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, I do not know you. And you
call me by a name not my own. Leave
my office."</p>

<p>"You fail to recognize me, Captain
Joaquin? Then I must show you a proof
of identity that you cannot fail to recognize.
Behold!"</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick tore open his shirt and
exposed the brand of a horseshoe.</p>

<p>There it was, never to be effaced, the
brand of a horseshoe that had seared
itself into the living flesh.</p>

<p>The man at the desk started to rise,
but could not do so; he was like one
partly paralyzed and partly bereft of
reason. He could only stare.</p>

<p>"Well, I see you recognize me now,"
said Dick.</p>

<p>"I deny it," was the gasped response.
"You are a crazy man. You are a lunatic.
Leave my office, or I will not be
responsible for your life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold! If you reach for a gun, or attempt
to call assistance, it will signal
your instant death, Red Rover. You and
I have a little account to settle and we
must have a chat."</p>

<p>"I tell you you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"I know that I am not. Let us not
dwell upon that, but come right to the
point. You cannot hope to make me
doubt what I know to be a fact. Now,
what vengeance do you suppose I will
take upon you for this?"</p>

<p>"I tell you you are making a mis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I made one mistake once with you,
but will not make another. You left me
for dead, but Providence was not done
with me yet&mdash;nor with you."</p>

<p>Perspiration was standing out upon the
man's forehead.</p>

<p>"How can I convince you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you are not Captain Joaquin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Bare your right arm, and if it contains
no scar, around from the shoulder
and diagonally to the elbow, then you
are not Captain Joaquin."</p>

<p>"Curse her! it was Susana told you
that!"</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps we can come to business.
I will sit down, and you will observe
silence and keep your hands in
plain sight on your desk."</p>

<p>Dick had a gun in hand, and was ready
to use it instantly.</p>

<p>"We must come to terms," said the
banker.</p>

<p>"And those terms will be mine," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"Name them, then."</p>

<p>"Give me, in funds, the amount that
was taken from the express train that
day."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! it is more than I have
got at my command on short notice like
this. I could not do it if my life depended
on it."</p>

<p>"Your life does depend on it."</p>

<p>"I must have time."</p>

<p>"You have just time to produce it, no
more."</p>

<p>There was a steely glitter in Deadwood
Dick's eyes.</p>

<p>This ex-outlaw quailed before him, and
Dick saw that he would yield to the demand.</p>

<p>"I must speak to my cashier," he said.</p>

<p>"Not necessary," said Dick.</p>

<p>"Otherwise I cannot procure the
funds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It will not go down, sir. I will step
with you into the other room, and there
you will open the safe and hand out the
amount."</p>

<p>A look of relief came suddenly into
the entrapped outlaw's eyes.</p>

<p>Deadwood Dick read his thought. A
smile curled his lips as he thought of the
further surprise in store for the rascal
if he acted upon the idea that had come
into his mind.</p>

<p>"I will do that," said the outlaw.</p>

<p>"Very well, get up and precede me."</p>

<p>The man rose from his chair, taking
care not to let it appear that he had any
thought of reaching for a weapon.</p>

<p>He believed&mdash;he knew that would signal
his instant death, after the treacherous
manner in which he had dealt with
Deadwood Dick on the former occasion,
and he could not risk it.</p>

<p>Going to the door, he opened it, and
the instant it was opened he leaped out,
shouting:</p>

<p>"A robber! Shoot him!"</p>

<p>A woman was before him.</p>

<p>Strange men were in possession of the
bank. Each of them had a badge on his
breast.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin looked around him in
dismay, and his face turned even more
deathly pale than ever, if possible.</p>

<p>The woman was Susana.</p>

<p>She was pale, but her face was determined.</p>

<p>With a quick movement the rascal
reached for a pistol, but Deadwood Dick
was upon him instantly.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he cried. "Whether
you meant to shoot her or yourself, is all
the same. Neither life can be spared
just yet. Johnson, disarm him."</p>

<p>One of the deputies stepped forward
and did so.</p>

<p>The clerks in the bank looked on with
open-mouthed amazement. And as each
of them had a man over him with a gun,
they believed it to be a robbery.</p>

<p>As soon as relieved of his weapons,
the fellow was allowed to go, and Dick
again ordered him to produce the money
from the safe, or order his cashier to do
so in his stead.</p>

<p>He refused to obey.</p>

<p>"Then we must help ourselves," said
Dick. "Bryce, you were express-agent
at that time, and know the sum that was
sent from the Castleville bank that day.
Take the same sum from this safe now."</p>

<p>Another of the deputies stepped forward
and entered the safe for the purpose.</p>

<p>He brought forth bundle after bundle
of the funds, until he had the required
amount in a pile on the nearest table.</p>

<p>"Is that right?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes, according to the markings."</p>

<p>"And that is no doubt correct. Pack
it up for transportation."</p>

<p>This the man proceeded to do, with the
utmost care and security, and at last it
was done and they were ready to depart.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Brown," said Deadwood
Dick, then, "we will take our leave. You
know the justice of this visit, and why
we have withdrawn by force a certain
deposit that was in your hands."</p>

<p>"Curse you!"</p>

<p>"We can go further, but the time is
not ripe. This is only the beginning of
your retribution."</p>

<p>"You are robbers! This is only a trick
to serve your purpose! I will have a
posse after you within ten minutes after
your departure!"</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>"I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Then perhaps we had better end the
business now. Shall I arrest you, make
known your true name here, and let the
citizens of this camp deal with you as
you deserve?"</p>

<p>"Go, and make the best of what you
have got. We will meet again some day,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then," said Dick, grimly.</p>

<p>He gave his men a signal and they left
the room, then Susana, and last of all,
Dick.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped for a last word
with the outlaw, upon whom had fallen
the first blow of a just vengeance.</p>

<p>"This is but the beginning," Dick said.
"You know what to expect at my hands.
I have drawn a cordon around you that
you cannot hope to escape, and it is only
a matter of time."</p>

<p>"Ha! I know you now!" was the last
desperate ruse. "You are Captain Joaquin,
the outlaw!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," said Dick.</p>

<p>He withdrew, and went down the
street. Susana was with him.</p>

<p>The others, somehow, had disappeared
already, and after these two turned a
corner, they, too, were seen no more.</p>

<p>It was as if the very earth had opened
and taken them in. And when, a little
later, the hue and cry of a daylight robbery
was raised, not a vestige of the
robbers could be found.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SECOND BLOW FALLS.</p>


<p>Powder Pocket was all excitement.</p>

<p>Banker Brown declared it was Captain
Joaquin who had made the raid.</p>

<p>Not that he knew that worthy by sight,
but so, he declared, the robber chief had
admitted in private.</p>

<p>The clerks could not dispute this, although
their impression had been that
the persons who made the raid were regular
officers of the law, and their side of
the story got out.</p>

<p>This, the banker averred, had been but
a clever trick, in case of discovery by
citizens during the time they were in the
bank. It had been one of the most remarkable
bank robberies on record. The
bank, however, could stand it, Mr. Brown
declared, and would not close its doors.</p>

<p>About a month prior to this time there
had come to Powder Pocket a man who
called himself Card-Sharp Cale.</p>

<p>Who he was, more than that, no one
knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>He was very dark of skin, almost as
swarthy as an Ethiopian, had long hair
and a beard of almost equal length.</p>

<p>With him was a younger man, his
brother, of similar complexion, some
years the junior of the other and beardless,
save for a slender mustache that
became him well.</p>

<p>These two had opened a gaming establishment.</p>

<p>It was a place where faro ruled, and
their bank was declared to be practically
limitless.</p>

<p>After a consultation with Banker
Brown, on coming to Powder Pocket, this
Card-Sharp Cale had deposited fifty
thousand dollars in Brown's bank, subject
to order.</p>

<p>It had been no uncommon thing for
checks of from five to twenty thousand
to be presented there of a morning, but
the deposits, as a rule, had been greater
than the withdrawals, and so, at the time
of the robbery, Card-Sharp Cale had
about a hundred thousand dollars on deposit.</p>

<p>On the morning after the robbery he
dropped in at the bank.</p>

<p>"How is your concern after your
loss?" he made inquiry, when greetings
had been exchanged.</p>

<p>"It is all right," was the answer. "I
have plenty of funds on hand yet that
the devils did not find. They took only
what was in sight."</p>

<p>"I understand they demanded a certain
sum."</p>

<p>"Yes, so they did. They thought that
was my pile. That, by the way, was the
capital I started with, and they must
have heard of it in some manner. But I
have doubled it since, to say nothing of
your big deposit, and others."</p>

<p>"Then you are ready to meet big
checks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all right."</p>

<p>"Because, as I was going to say, luck
went against me last night and my bank
went broke."</p>

<p>The banker paled.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My checks are out to the tune
of some sixty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew! Beaten at your own game.
This is serious; I must find out just what
we have got on hand at once."</p>

<p>He went into the outer room, and his
caller smiled as the door closed after
him. There was something familiar about
that smile, now that Card-Sharp Cale
was alone.</p>

<p>When the banker returned his face
was like death.</p>

<p>"I am in a hole," he declared. "A
check has just been paid to the tune of
thirty-four thousand, and there is not
five thousand left on hand."</p>

<p>"This is serious, Mr. Brown. I have
got to have my balance, or I shall have
to close my game to-night for want of
funds. You must gather in all you can
and make me whole."</p>

<p>"What is your balance, less this check
I speak of?"</p>

<p>"It must be fifty thousand."</p>

<p>"I can't do it, on short notice; you will
have to give me time. Will you force me
to the wall?"</p>

<p>"You can pay or you cannot pay, and
in the latter case you are at the wall already.
There is nothing for me to do in
the matter; I must have what is due me."</p>

<p>"Give me a week."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Think of the loss to me."</p>

<p>"Then give me three days&mdash;two days,
one! I tell you I am unable to meet your
demand."</p>

<p>"You must close your doors, then."</p>

<p>"And that will ruin me."</p>

<p>"You are ruined already."</p>

<p>"And you will not spare me?"</p>

<p>"How can I, and why should I?"</p>

<p>"As one man to another, you should."</p>

<p>"And see my own business ruined. No,
no; that is not business, as business goes.
I must have what is due me; and, besides
my deposit I have been accepting
papers of yours, believing them to be
perfectly good, and they will make up a
nice sum."</p>

<p>Brown wiped the perspiration from his
face.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing you can do."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Convey your property here to me for
security."</p>

<p>"And go forth a beggar?"</p>

<p>"Can I help that?"</p>

<p>"Be merciful."</p>

<p>"Do you show mercy?"</p>

<p>"I would, were our positions changed."</p>

<p>"What about that loan made to Hiram
Smith which you foreclosed only a few
days ago?"</p>

<p>"He is a beat; he never meant to pay."</p>

<p>"I do not believe that. Had I known
of it in time I would have saved him. For
a few paltry hundreds you scooped in his
property worth thousands."</p>

<p>"That was business; he could not pay,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you see where you are, don't
you? This is business, as I said. It is
your own kind of business. Can you
square accounts with me, Mr. Brown, if
I give you an hour?"</p>

<p>"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Then I must take possession here,
and will send at once for the proper authorities."</p>

<p>"You will take charge? By what
right?"</p>

<p>"By the right of might."</p>

<p>"You cannot trust me, then, an hour?"</p>

<p>"Not a minute. Practically, you are
my prisoner."</p>

<p>The ex-outlaw flushed, and his hand
sought his hip, but he was covered in a
trice by a brace of guns.</p>

<p>"No you don't!" was the cry. "Bring
that hand up from there, and bring it
up empty, too! Call in your chief clerk
and tell him to close the bank and put
up a notice!"</p>

<p>"I dare not; the people will mob me if
I do that."</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and
the cashier looked in, taking in the situation.</p>

<p>"A check for thirty thousand dollars,
sir!" he said.</p>

<p>"It is yours," said Brown, turning appealingly
to Card-Sharp Cale.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is."</p>

<p>"Can't you hold it back and give me
a chance?"</p>

<p>"Not a minute. You have my money
on demand; meet my paper or take the
consequence."</p>

<p>"But, the robbery."</p>

<p>"Your loss, not mine."</p>

<p>"I could kill you, curse you!"</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it; you have tried that
before."</p>

<p>Instantly the man was upon his feet,
and his visitor removed his long, curling
beard.</p>

<p>Lo! it was Dick Bristol again! No mistaking
that face, even though stained,
as we have described. He smiled, and his
revolvers covered the rascal's heart.</p>

<p>The cashier might have tried to interfere,
but at that moment into the room
slipped Card-Sharp Cale's brother, "Joe,"
he was called, and he, too, had a pair of
guns in hand. And Joaquin Escala, utterly
overcome, sank cowering upon his
chair.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE THIRD STROKE.</p>


<p>Deadwood Dick was as inexorable as
fate.</p>

<p>This the rascal knew, and he did not
dare lift his head to ask further mercy.</p>

<p>"Well what shall it be?" asked Bristol.
"Will you sign all over to me, or
shall the expose be made here and now?
I give you the choice."</p>

<p>"You will give me a chance?"</p>

<p>"I give you that choice. I intend to
crush you by degrees."</p>

<p>"And if I do as you say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will give you a respite of twelve
hours."</p>

<p>"I will do it. Cashier, tell that man
the bank has to suspend. Put up a notice
to close the doors."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"And say nothing about what you
have seen in this room."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"And say to him, further, that he
must return his check to the man who
drew it," supplemented Card-Sharp Cale.</p>

<p>The cashier withdrew.</p>

<p>"Now, pard," remarked Dick to Susana,
for it was she, of course. "Go and
bring here two lawyers. Be as quick as
you can, and this business shall be done
in proper fashion."</p>

<p>The girl withdrew, and Dick and his
arch enemy were alone together.</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin was silent.</p>

<p>"When these lawyers come," explained
the Dead-Set Detective, "you will be allowed
to transfer your property by the
name in which you hold it. Your real
name need not yet appear. As I said, I
give you a respite."</p>

<p>"And my liberty during that respite?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is all I ask."</p>

<p>"And it is a great deal more than you
deserve."</p>

<p>In due time the lawyers were ushered
in, and both greeted Banker Brown servilely.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," remarked the banker,
"I am caught in a trap, and am obliged
to wind up my affairs at once. I must
transfer my possessions to this gentleman
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ahem!" interrupted one of the lawyers.
"Forced to suspend, eh? You want
a receiver, that is all; let him take your
affairs and straighten them out as best
he can. Or, declare yourself bankrupt,
and let your creditors get what they
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably Mr. Brown will do the business
in his own way," suggested Deadwood
Dick.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly!"</p>

<p>"The bulk of my obligation is to this
gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All of it, I think," from Dick. "I
have gathered up every scrap of your paper."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I intend to deed over to
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sum of fifty thousand dollars,"
interrupted Bristol. "All the rest of your
property, real and personal, you will
transfer to Susana Maxton, without reserve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will do nothing of the kind!" asserted
one of the lawyers. "There is a
law in the land, sir, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he will do as he pleases, eh?"</p>

<p>"It is forced."</p>

<p>"Ask him if it is."</p>

<p>"It is my will," avowed the cutthroat.
"You will draw up papers according to
my dictation, gentlemen."</p>

<p>That settled the point. The papers
were duly drawn and signed and attested,
and the second move in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
game had been made successfully. But,
there was another yet to follow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was night, and a man was softly
stealing his way out of Powder Pocket.</p>

<p>"Banker Brown," ruined, was trying
to elude his mortal foe, and he believed
he could do so.</p>

<p>Little had been seen of Brown the remainder
of the day, after the business
transaction at the bank, and Card-Sharp
Cale, and Joe, too, had disappeared.</p>

<p>In disguise, as a miserable, hungry
outcast, Captain Joaquin was trying to
escape with his life, with a bitter resolve
in his heart that, sooner or later, he
would square the account with his implacable
foe, Deadwood Dick.</p>

<p>Out of camp he stole, unhindered, and
off into the hills.</p>

<p>For a time he used caution, but, at
last, feeling that escape was assured, he
ran, and did not stop until he was nearly
breathless.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he panted, shaking his
fist in the direction of the camp. "I have
escaped, and you shall yet hear from me!
Your inning this time, Dick Bristol, but
mine will come!"</p>

<p>He fairly gnashed his teeth in his impotent
rage.</p>

<p>"You are not done with Captain Joaquin,"
he vowed, in emphatic tone. "He
will yet suck your life's blood from your
veins&mdash;and yours, too, accursed Susana!
It was all through you that this blow fell
upon me. I will take to the road again;
I will gather my men around me once
more, and nothing shall stop my career."</p>

<p>Of a sudden light flashed upon the
scene, and a woman stood before him&mdash;Susana&mdash;with
a leveled revolver!</p>

<p>"I will not bear the blame that does
not belong to me," she said, her voice
firm, but her face pale. "There was a
time when I could, and would, have followed
you to death, but you blasted my
love by your cruel suspicions. You
wrongly accused me, and you would not
show mercy where mercy was deserved.
You turned my love to hate, and now I
am your most bitter foe."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" the outlaw laughed.
"So, wildcat, it is you? I am glad we
have met, for my vengeance must begin
with you. Drop that gun, or, by the stars
above, I will drop you!"</p>

<p>He dodged and drew his own weapons;
but, in the same second, he was grabbed
from behind by strong hands.</p>

<p>It was in vain he struggled.</p>

<p>"Did you hope to escape me?" asked
Deadwood Dick. "You were a fool to
think it. Do you know what is in store
for you? Let me first bind your hands,
and I will tell you."</p>

<p>Dick was not alone; there were other
men besides himself, who held the prisoner
while Dick bound him.</p>

<p>"There," he said, having tied the road-ruffian's
hands, "now you are safe. Perhaps
you remember what you did for me.
Perhaps you remember this horseshoe.
Perhaps you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Joaquin uttered a scream.</p>

<p>"You do not mean to brand me!"</p>

<p>"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth," assured Dick.</p>

<p>"Anything but that&mdash;anything but
that! Shoot me, hang me, but do not
brand me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it will hurt you no worse than
it hurt me," averred Bristol, with a
laugh. "If life is spared you, it may
teach you a lesson of mercy to others.
You are to be branded."</p>

<p>The wretch cried, begged to be spared;
but all to no purpose. Dick called his
men around him and told them the story,
and his decision met their hearty approval.
Not only so, but Susana exhibited
no sign of pity or mercy for the cowering
wretch.</p>

<p>A fire was made, and the horseshoe
was heated.</p>

<p>"Now," announced Dick, when all was
ready, "I will repay you in your own
coin. This is the very same iron that
branded me, and, while I do not fancy
wearing a brand the same as yours&mdash;or
allowing you to wear one similar to
mine, rather&mdash;yet justice demands it. I
feel again that iron searing my flesh; I
feel again the rope around my neck; I
hear again your mocking laughter, you
execrable villain!"</p>

<p>"Have mercy! Have mercy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will have mercy; I will not
hang you. I will give you your life. Hand
me the iron!"</p>

<p>The victim writhed and screamed in
anticipation of the acute agony he must
suffer, as the iron was handed to Dick by
a piece of wire caught in one of the
nail holes.</p>

<p>Dick Bristol took the wire and held the
red-hot shoe over the bare breast of his
foe, smiling at his plea for mercy and
his request for death at once, speedy and
sure. He held it near enough for its
heat to be keenly felt, and the cries of
the craven wretch for mercy were indeed
pitiful.</p>

<p>"Such mercy as you showed me!" reminded
the detective. "I ought to brand
your face with it instead of your breast.
Suppose I lay it on your forehead and
call you Cain? But, no, I will do no
worse than you did to me. I will be
merciful that far. When you feel it bite
your flesh, when the smell of your own
burning greets your nostrils, think of
your own unmerciful act."</p>

<p>Dick moved as if to lay the shoe on
the bare flesh, but hesitated. He glanced
at Susana. She was standing by, her
eyes on the ground, not a muscle moving.
He recalled how she had pleaded
for him, and contrasted her silence now.
What were her thoughts? He looked
again at his writhing victim, and allowed
the voice within him to speak&mdash;the voice
that had been struggling to be heard,
yet which had been suppressed by his
iron will.</p>

<p>"No, I will not!" he said, as if speaking
to some one invisible to the others.
"Let my punishment consist in showing
mercy where mercy is not deserved."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he flung the hot iron as
far as he could among the bushes and
boulders.</p>

<p>"Thank God!"</p>

<p>It was Susana, and she threw her
arms around the detective's neck.</p>

<p>"Not that I care for him," she said;
"he deserved it, and I would not have
lifted a finger; but I thank God that you
are more merciful!"</p>

<p>Dick kissed her, in turn, and ordered
his men to lift the outlaw from the
ground. This they did, and led him
away. In due course the road-ruffian was
found guilty and imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>When Susana came into the property
which had been deeded to her, and had
turned it into cash, Bristol saw her safely
to her friends, and there took leave of
her. She had been a true pard, and he
almost loved her. That she did love him
was not to be doubted, and if ever he
wanted a true friend he knew where to
find one.</p>
